In this study, you will read a weekly journal written by a student in a
semester-long collaborative group project. The entries document the fourteen
(14) weeks of the project. The student is fictional, so his or her privacy is
immaterial. As you read each narrative, you will decide <em>which
<strong>one</strong> of the listed behaviors <strong>best</strong>
characterizes the group's dynamic that week.</em>

</p>

<p>
After you have performed the above task for the fourteen weeks
of the narrative, you will be asked for your overall evaluation
of the group's behavior, using the same list of behaviors.
