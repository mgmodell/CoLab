      This value reflects your average level of completion of the
      simulated groupwork experiences assigned to you within CoLab.
    inst_p1: >
      In this experience, you will read a weekly journal written by a student in a
      semester-long collaborative group project. The entries document the fourteen
      (14) weeks of the project. The student is fictional, so his or her privacy is
      immaterial. As you read each narrative, you will decide <em>which
      <strong>one</strong> of the listed behaviors <strong>best</strong>
      characterizes the group's dynamic that week.</em>
    inst_p2: >
      After you have performed the above task for the fourteen weeks
      of the narrative, you will be asked for your overall evaluation
      of the group's behavior, using the same list of behaviors.

      Please <em>do not use your browser's <strong>back</strong> button</em> during
      the experience. If you need to stop for any reason, you can pick up where you
      left off whenever you return.
    scenario_p1: >
      Students in this class are working on a research paper in groups of four, with
      three other students they've not worked with before. They will have 14 weeks to
      complete the paper.
    scenario_p2: >
      The first assignment, due in week 5, is to submit the group's selected paper
      topic and a preliminary list of references with summaries. In week 9, students
      will turn in a rough draft.  Week 13 will see each group making a formal
      presentation of their work to the entire class and the final paper will be
      delivered to the instructor by the end of week 14.
    scenario_p3: >
      Each group is expected to meet and work on this project outside of class, and
      it is recommended that they schedule recurring meetings. Finally, each student
      is required to maintain a weekly reflective journal detailing every member's
      contributions so the instructor can understand how the group works together.
