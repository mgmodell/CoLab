      student_description: >
        Contribute to the design space of GRATITUDE. Use human-centered
        design approaches to develop a new way to express, share, or
        deliver our gratitude, affection, kindness, or appreciation to
        the broader communities at this critical time. Gratitude empowers
        us, stimulates positivity in our thoughts, and enhances both our
        physical and mental well-being.
