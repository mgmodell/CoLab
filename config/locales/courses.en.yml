      name_number_ttl: What course is this?
      name_number_desc: >
        Please enter the course title and the course identifier. These
        are how the course will be presented to you and your students.
        You are free to enter whatever you'd like, but most schools have
        both names and numbers that students and instructors will be
        familiar with and these should be used here.
      course_description_desc: >
        Below you can enter a description of the course. It is rarely
        shown to students or instructors, so this is optional and
        primarily for your benefit.
      dates_ttl: When will this course run?
      dates_desc: >
        Please enter the start and end date for this course. All
        course activities must fall within these dates as we use this
        information to perform some sanity checks and make sure
        activities aren't accidentally planned for dates that won't make
        any sense.
      dates_timezone: >
        We assume that this course will run in the {{timezone}} timezone
        just like your school. However, you can click here to change
        this. Perhaps for a study abroad course?
      confirm_save_ttl: Is this all correct?
      confirm_save_desc: >
        Please review all the information we've captured so far to make
        sure it's correct before we save it. If anything is incorrect,
        you can use the buttons above to go to fix it. After the course
        is saved, you'll be able to add activities and begin enrolling
        students.
