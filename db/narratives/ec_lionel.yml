    <p> In group time, we began by setting up weekly team meetings. This
    project is pretty huge and I don't think any of us have had to do one like
    this before.  I know how to work hard, though &mdash; I had a rough time at
    my previous college, before I could bring my grades up enough to transfer
    in here. The rest of my group are freshmen, and it looks like they all knew
    each other already. I felt a bit left out, but that's life, I guess. </p>

    <p> The project is fairly open-ended, so we brainstormed topic ideas for
    most of the first meeting. Natasha's ideas were easily the most fun &mdash;
    while Alex and I were suggesting fairly standard things, she managed to
    keep coming up with interesting perspectives. Not all of them were
    appropriate, but they sure kept the discussion lively, and it didn't take
    much to make them useable.  </p>

    <p> Anika was quiet. I could tell that she was paying attention, but I
    guess she's a bit shy. When we started to slow down a bit, I realized that
    no one was taking any notes, so we tried to run back through the ideas
    while I wrote them down. We talked about the ones we remembered. </p>

    <p> Before the meeting ended, we narrowed it down to six ideas. We decided
    to all look for resources on all the topics. We will discuss them and
    decide on one next week. </p>

    <p> During the week, I tried to look for stuff on all six topics, but while
    they all sounded good during the meeting, only two of them really seem to
    work for our project. Interestingly, one of the two was one that I'm pretty
    sure started with a joke by Natasha. After an hour, I felt well-prepared
    for those two topics, but I kept looking for stuff on the other topics for
    another hour to make sure I had something for all the rest. </p>

    <p> Anika found a lot of materials for one of the topics that I had a rough
    time with, but Alex and Natasha also focused on the same two as I did. We
    ended up with a lot of duplication, but at least we all know those topics.
    When we dug into what Anika found for the third topic, I couldn't see how
    we would be able to use much of it &mdash; the research just had mentions
    of what we needed. Our discussion quickly became about our most promising
    two topics. </p>

    <p> We had a lot of discussion about which to choose &mdash; everyone had
    an opinion. Then Natasha suggested that we try to combine them. We wasted
    ten minutes trying to see if we could make that work, but ultimately we
    couldn't. We wound up back where we started. Our first vote split evenly
    down the middle, but Alex started writing pros and cons; seeing that made
    both Anika and I change our votes. The other topic, although more exciting,
    would have probably been more difficult. </p>

    <p> The obvious next step was to find more materials, so we divided up the
    major subtopics amongst ourselves. We decided everyone would return next
    week with summaries of what they'd found to make it easier for the group to
    get moving quickly. Alex also split up the duplicates among us. </p>

    <p> I found some more materials, and then I spent an hour writing and
    proofreading those summaries. Everyone in my group really seems to belong
    here. It's going to be tough to keep up, but if I lose my scholarship, I'm
    finished. </p>

    <p> During our meeting, we began sorting through the materials. I showed
    mine first to get it over with, and no one had any complaints. Natasha made
    me laugh when she misread one of my summaries and shone a completely
    different light on it. It turned into an interesting suggestion, too.  </p>

    <p> Natasha's contributions were solid and we didn't spend too much time on
    them. Alex's materials were difficult to understand and we needed his help
    to interpret what he meant. He seemed a bit embarrassed and told us he'd
    rewrite the summaries to make them clearer.  </p>

    <p> Anika's summaries were just a sentence or two each. I don't know how
    she thought that would be useful to us. After some awkward moments, Alex
    asked her if she'd prefer to use Natasha's summaries or her own to write
    the paper, and I think it clicked for her. We all had things to do to
    improve our work for next week. </p>

    <p> I carried Natasha's suggestion through my summaries and I think I did a
    pretty good job, but it really didn't take much time. I felt like I should
    be doing more, but couldn't think of anything to do, so I mostly focused on
    my other classes this week. </p>

    <p> Anika wasn't at the meeting when I got there. She hadn't been in class,
    and no one had heard anything from her. We weren't sure what was going on.
    </p>

    <p> When it looked like she wouldn't be coming, we began working through
    Alex's updated materials; they were much improved. They could use some
    editing, but at least they made sense now, and he is obviously very smart.
    I think maybe his mind races ahead of his fingers. I volunteered to try to
    redo Anika's work and put what we had together for the assignment due next
    week, but Natasha said no. She said she'd work on Anika's part and get it
    to me to three days before class so I could include them. She also asked
    Alex to put together a basic outline of what the paper should look like so
    we could get started on that. Alex agreed, and I thought it was a great
    idea for him to keep us moving forward. </p>

    <p> Natasha got me the materials a day early, and I had plenty of time to
    put everything together. It took half an hour to put it all together and
    another half to clean it all up.  </p>

    <p> The next evening, Anika got in touch with all of us, explaining that
    her mother had taken ill and that she'd had to return home to be with her
    in the hospital. She'd also included the materials she'd been working on.
    They were much improved &mdash; better in most cases than what Natasha had
    been able to put together. I was glad to have them, but it meant another
    forty five minutes to merge them with what Natasha provided. </p>

    <p> I turned in our assignment this week in class, and our instructor gave
    us some time to meet as a group. We spent the time looking at Alex's
    outline since that was the only new thing we had. I thought it was decent,
    but Anika and Natasha seemed to feel differently. We didn't have enough
    time to really get into it during class, but it was clear that the three of
    them had different visions of what the paper should look like. </p>

    <p> Alex had made a few changes and once it was clear what those visions
    were, I had to admit that they all had good ideas. I didn't have much to
    say at first because I don't usually outline my papers &mdash; I just start
    writing, but working in a group we have to agree on who is writing what.
    After 30 minutes of arguing (that I mostly stayed out of), we modified
    Alex's outline to incorporate much of what Natasha wanted. Over the course
    of the discussion, Natasha won Anika over to her perspective. </p>

    <p> With the outline settled, Anika suggested we split the outline up into
    quarters and each write one for next week. I spoke up quickly for the
    second section because I wasn't sure I could write the introduction or the
    conclusion. Fortunately, Natasha took the former and Anika took the latter.
    </p>

    <p> It took me two hours to write my part of the paper, but then I spent
    another half hour proofreading it. I don't think it's great, but hopefully
    when the others review it, they'll be able to do what I can't. While I was
    writing, I was reminded of a paper that I'd written during my own freshman
    year. I did a good job with it and this one has a lot of similarities
    &mdash; completely different topic, but it made me feel a bit more
    comfortable. </p>

    <p> This week's meeting was uncomfortable. I thought the rest of the group
    would be able to help me smooth out the rough parts of my piece, but it
    turned out everyone had similar rough spots. No one was really able to make
    his or her piece work quite right. We had to rethink our whole approach.
    </p>

    <p> Anika once again brought out her initial preference from last time, but
    Alex was a step ahead of her and pointed out where we'd run into the same
    problems that way. After listening for a bit, I told the team about that
    paper I'd written two years ago, because it seemed relevant. Alex jumped on
    it immediately. He said he thought it was a really good idea and could work
    well &mdash; especially in light of the past two weeks' in-class lectures.
    </p>

    <p> Natasha and Anika joined in and modified the outline. There were a
    couple of places where I was able to offer some suggestions and help, too.
    About halfway into our meeting, we started looking back at the pieces we'd
    already written to see if/where they still fit. It looked like we would be
    left with about half a paper still to write. </p>

    <p> This time, we each took pieces that were left to write. I didn't care
    which parts I took, but Anika and Natasha sure did. It seemed like they
    argued about almost all of them, but ultimately we all wound up with pieces
    we could handle. </p>

    <p> One of my parts was pretty straightforward and I wrote it in half an
    hour, but the other one gave me a lot of trouble. For some reason, I just
    couldn't make it work properly, so I set it aside. The next night I still
    couldn't seem to get a handle on it, so I contacted Alex to see if we could
    work it out together.  </p>

    <p> We met up for about an hour and he answered all my questions. We then
    looked at his work. I often couldn't understand what he was saying and
    needed to ask him to explain things more thoroughly. I felt pretty stupid,
    but he said that I helped him and sounded sincere. </p>

    <p> I was late this week by about ten minutes because I had a study session
    for one of my midterms coming next week. However, I was only the second
    person to arrive. Natasha walked in five minutes later, out of breath from
    running to the meeting, and Alex didn't arrive for almost half an hour.
    Both of them were coming from midterm preps. </p>

    <p> In spite of this, everyone was happier with what we had this week and,
    after running through what we had, the paper is starting to look pretty
    good. We spent much of our time assembling the pieces into a single paper.
    When we did, we realized that neither the introduction nor the conclusion
    worked very well any longer. Natasha asked that I write the introduction,
    saying that the new structure of the paper was my idea, but it wasn't. They
    were the ones who put most of it together &mdash; all I did was mention a
    past project I'd done. I said I'd do it only if one of them would review it
    the following week. Anika said she'd be happy to.  </p>

    <p> Alex volunteered to rework the conclusion, but Natasha quickly asked
    him instead to proofread and format the document while she rewrote the
    conclusion. He was happy with this. I'm glad, because his writing is pretty
    bad. Hopefully he does a better job with editing. Anika said she'd
    proofread the document as well &mdash; just to have an extra set of eyes on
    it.  </p>

    <p> Natasha also told us she'd be late next week because one of her
    midterms would run until the start of this meeting. </p>

    <p> Writing the introduction wasn't really very difficult at all, and only
    took me half an hour &mdash; I just hope it's what they're looking for. I
    re-read it later in the week to make sure I couldn't improve on it, but it
    still seemed OK, so I'll just wait to hear what my teammates say. </p>

    <p> While Alex may not be good at making sure he puts all the right details
    in himself, he is good at making sure everyone else puts them in. He found
    all sorts of issues all over the paper. Most of them were pretty small, but
    a few would have to wait for after we turn in the draft next week. They
    weren't horrible or anything, so that's fine. He also made the whole paper
    look exactly the way the instructor asked us to (at least as near as I
    could tell). It looks very professional. Anika also did a good job and
    noted a few things that Alex missed, but she also missed many of the items
    that Alex found. Why couldn't Alex do this with his own work? </p>

    <p> Natasha showed up just as we were finishing up with Alex and Anika's
    work. We took a look at my introduction, and Anika asked why it was so
    short before she even read it. I didn't know what to say, so I just
    shrugged and they read it. They were all quiet for a moment until Natasha
    shrugged and admitted that she couldn't think of anything that was missing
    and Alex agreed.  </p>

    <p> Anika thought for another moment and then she, too, agreed that nothing
    was missing. She had some ideas for beefing it up a bit, though. Ten
    minutes later, we had a new version that was longer and felt a bit more
    complete. Her conclusion looked great to me, and only Alex made a
    suggestion. </p>

    <p> When we were done, Anika said she'd add in the conclusion, make the
    changes we talked about and have a version of the paper ready to turn in
    next week in class. Natasha said that she'd try to make the larger changes
    that Alex suggested. I wasn't sure what I could do this week because we
    seemed to be in pretty good shape, but I said I'd start building a
    PowerPoint for the upcoming presentation. Alex asked if anyone minded if he
    didn't do anything this week because he had a late midterm next week in his
    toughest subject. </p>

    <p> I don't know what I was thinking when I volunteered for the PowerPoint.
    I had no idea what to put in it. After staring at a blank presentation for
    about 20 minutes, I took our outline and made slides for each major topic.
    Seeing this, I rearranged it a little bit and added in some sub-headings,
    but mostly I didn't do anything with it. </p>

    <p> Anika not only brought a copy of our paper to class for the instructor,
    but also brought copies for each of us to look at between class and our
    meeting. This way, we didn't waste our meeting time on reading through it.
    As a bonus, Natasha had merged her changes into this latest version. She'd
    unfortunately had a difficult time making those changes and they were not
    complete. She brought a list of questions and possible answers and we spent
    twenty minutes on that before we came to any answers.  </p>

    <p> Alex was pretty quiet during the discussion. At one point, though, he
    said he thought he had an idea after seeing what Natasha had done. He asked
    if he could take it home and work on it for next week; no one argued with
    that. </p>

    <p> We next discussed the presentation &mdash; beginning with the
    PowerPoint I put together. Before Anika could comment, I pointed out that
    this was just a start and that I knew there wasn't much to it. I said I
    thought everyone should claim a few slides and modify them when they worked
    on what they were going to say. At this, Anika just shut her mouth and I
    have to admit, that was pretty satisfying. It felt good to anticipate her
    questions and head them off.  </p>

    <p> Natasha chose a few slides, including the first one, but I said that I
    wanted to introduce us. I don't think either of us had a very good reason
    for wanting to begin the presentation. Neither Alex nor Anika had any
    opinion on it, so we decided that we'd both give it a shot and see which
    one we all like best when we practice next week. I'm kind of excited about
    making it into a bit of a competition. </p>

    <p> I spent a lot more time on the introduction slide than I did on the
    others this week, but I didn't completely ignore them. I built out my
    slides a bit with some clipart and a few more bullet points, but they were
    pretty good as they were. For the introduction, I included little photos of
    everyone and had them bounce in. Then I animated the quick overview with
    "whoosh" effects. It's a bit cheesy, but I like it. </p>

- !ruby/object:Week_
  week_num: 10
  text_ko:  
  text_en: |
    <p> So, maybe I should have spent some more time on what I would say in the
    introduction and less time on the slides (I think I went overboard).
    Natasha will open the presentation and I feel pretty dumb. On the plus
    side, they liked using the little photos of us all and they didn't hate the
    "whoosh" effect &mdash; but we're not keeping it, either. Everyone else
    sounded so much better than I did and I feel way out of my league.  </p>

    <p> I did get a lot of good suggestions, but they all seem so obvious that
    I should have known them. They all had recommendations for each other, too,
    but theirs didn't seem nearly as obvious as mine. I was really feeling like
    I could handle this, and then they showed me just how much I don't belong
    here. Anika seemed especially disappointed. </p>

    <p> After class, Alex hung back and offered to help me fix things this
    week, but at that moment, I couldn't imagine how anyone could possibly fix
    my awful performance, so I said no. </p>

    <p> When I got back to my room, I regretted it. I realized it's way too
    late to drop the class. I should have said yes, but I figured what was done
    was done. I'd just have to try hard not to let them down too much again. I
    made all the specific changes they suggested, and I practiced about a
    billion times for anyone who would sit still long enough. I swear, my
    roommate and my mom must have my part of the presentation memorized at this
    point, but I will not let my team down again. </p>

    <p> In class, the instructor returned the drafts, and we met briefly during
    class to review it. There weren't many comments. Most of them were pretty
    minor or issues that Natasha had already fixed. There was one comment that
    concerned me, though: a diagram might help here. I can't believe that this
    was the first time I realized we were presenting our instructor with a
    great big wall of text! How could I have missed that? I took the document
    home and sketched out ideas for four diagrams I felt would help us to
    communicate our point. </p>

    <p> I got to the meeting late, and everyone was already talking about our
    complete lack of images. I apologized and pulled out my sketches, and
    everyone's faces lit up. My sketches weren't very good, but I think they
    helped everyone to come up with better ideas. After 30 minutes, Natasha
    (who is a much better artist than I), had three good diagrams to work with.
    She said she'd be happy to build them out and add them to the paper for
    next week. </p>

    <p> We spent the rest of the meeting working through the presentation, and
    everyone sounded better this week. Anika even commented that mine had
    improved dramatically. I noticed a bunch of mistakes, but no one talked
    about them. Feeling better about the presentation, I was better able to
    listen to their parts and offer them feedback. I noticed that Alex was
    speaking too quietly, while Anika was a bit too fast.  </p>

    <p> Alex included something that I didn't remember from anywhere in the
    paper. He told me where he'd found the information, and I believe him
    because he's got a great memory, but I wasn't sure that we wanted to talk
    in the presentation about something that we didn't mention in the paper.
    Natasha and Anika didn't think it was a big deal, but I feel like it's a
    bad idea. If it's important enough to talk about, shouldn't we write about
    it, too? Isn't this supposed to be a presentation of what we've learned? I
    asked Alex to add it to the paper, but he didn't think it was necessary,
    and neither did Anika or Natasha. I think everyone's getting tired and just
    wants to be done with this. Finally, I just said that I'd add it into the
    paper myself. </p>

    <p> I only spent half an hour making the small addition to our paper and
    practicing this week. </p>

- !ruby/object:Week_
  week_num: 12
  text_ko:  
  text_en: |
    <p> The images Natasha put together really added a lot to our paper and I
    can see them making it easier for people to understand some aspects of it.
    I also claimed one of the images for one of my slides, because it would
    speak so much better than the bullet points I had on there. I can't believe
    we didn't have any images in at all until now. </p>

    <p> This week the presentation was much better. After another three
    practice runs, it sounded smooth. Alex was consistently speaking loud
    enough to be heard by the audience and we'd slowed Anika down. I was a
    little bit frustrated to find that, after our argument last week, Alex
    removed the bit they forced me to add into the paper. It's not as though
    it's out of place or that it needed to be in the presentation, but why
    couldn't he have just gotten rid of it last week when I asked him about it?
    </p>

    <p> Natasha added the photos of us to her introduction slide, and I have to
    admit, her intro was much better than mine. Finally, and arguably most
    importantly, we managed to cut it down to the correct time. </p>

    <p> I practiced a few more times during the week when I was able to find a
    moment. </p>

    <p> The presentation went OK, but not quite as smoothly as I'd hoped. Alex
    seemed a bit nervous and got quiet, but I'm pretty sure that most people
    heard him. Anika, on the other hand, raced through her presentation and as
    a result, I don't think anyone understood her. We wound up finishing up
    about 30 seconds early &mdash; I can't imagine that's a good thing.  </p>

    <p> Our classmates asked some good questions, which showed that they
    understood most of our presentation. Anika, who spoke last, naturally
    received all the questions, but she handed them off to whomever she felt
    was best suited to answer them. There weren't a lot of questions, but I got
    to answer two and I felt good about being able to do that in front of our
    instructor.  </p>

    <p> We should have discussed clothes beforehand. I came slacks and a sports
    jacket, and Natasha wore a dress skirt and blouse. Alex and Anika were
    dressed very casually, and it was a bit uncomfortable. </p>

    <p> Generally, though, I think we felt good about the work we'd done. I
    expect positive feedback and good grades. </p>

    <p> We only met briefly this week because we were mostly finished and we
    all had finals to study for, but Alex said that he had time to go through
    it once more. Quite frankly, he's the best person to do it, so no one
    disagreed. We also agreed that we'd only meet briefly next week to make
    sure Alex didn't find any huge problems. </p>

    <p> At the final meeting, we reviewed the paper to make sure it was ready
    for submission at the end of the week. As we went through it, Anika took
    issue with a few of the changes Alex made. It didn't seem like anything
    until she pointed it out that some of the language he used was a bit
    ambiguous, and it could be read to mean the opposite of what we intended.
    </p>

    <p> It took us all a while to see it because we all know what we're trying
    to say, but once I saw it, I couldn't un-see it. Alex seemed to have the
    hardest time of it, and he hesitantly volunteered to fix it before
    submission, but we could all see that was a bad idea. Anika said she had no
    problem doing it as long as everyone trusted her, because there wasn't
    enough time for her to make the changes and get us all to say OK in time.
    Of course we all trusted her and said so. </p>

    <p> The night before she sent it in to our instructor, Anika sent us a copy
    of the document to make sure we were all OK with it. I didn't have a chance
    to read it carefully, but I wrote back and said OK. </p>
