    <p> In group time the first week, we began by setting up weekly team
    meetings. I think we got lucky because Anna is already a sophomore while
    the rest of us are freshmen. It seems like she knows what she's doing. </p>

    <p> The project is fairly open-ended, so we brainstormed topic ideas for
    the rest of the time. Kim was quiet, but Jose, Anna and I all volunteered a
    few topics. Two of mine were meant to be jokes, but no one seemed to
    understand them. The third was serious, but no one seemed to understand it,
    either, which is frustrating. Everyone loved it when Anna suggested the
    same thing a little later. She had a bunch of good ideas and I don't think
    she was stealing my idea or anything, I just said it wrong. Anyway,
    everyone thinks Anna is brilliant, so we focused on her suggestions. </p>

    <p> Before the meeting ended, we narrowed it down to five ideas. Anna told
    us we should each look for resources on one topic and then report back next
    week. She spoke up for the topic she explained more clearly than me, and I
    quickly spoke up for another one I liked. After a few moments, Jose took
    another. Kim said she'd take the last two, but I guess Anna's concerned, so
    she offered to take one herself. However, Kim insisted that she could
    handle it, and eventually Anna split it with her. </p>

    <p> I spent about 30 minutes researching my topic this week and I think
    we're off to a good start, so I feel pretty good. </p>

    <p> We began the meeting by going over the materials we collected over the
    last week. Anna was clearly disappointed, but I didn't understand what the
    problem was. This was only the second week and we were just trying to
    narrow down the topic.  </p>

    <p> Anna laughed and started asking questions about the materials I'd
    found. They were very in-depth questions, and it's not as though we needed
    to know all of that now. However, she argued that we would need to know the
    answers to evaluate the topics effectively, and she could answer those
    questions for hers. I didn't agree with her, but I didn't want to fight
    about it, so I said I did. </p>

    <p> Jose suggested that, in the interest of time, maybe we just go with the
    topic she worked on, but Anna insisted told us that we had to redo our
    work. She pointed out that we all need to be able to do the research
    &mdash; and maybe one of the other topics would be better for our group.
    She's going to be a pain in the neck. We all agreed with her and said we'd
    redo our work. </p>

    <p> The next night, I spent about another hour and a half on finding and
    skimming through new materials. Most of my materials were still fine, but I
    read more of them and now I can defend them. I found some extras, as well.
    I'm really liking this topic and I'm becoming convinced that this is the
    one to go with. There's lots of material on it and it's just plain
    interesting! </p>

    <p> During this week's meeting, we sorted through the materials we've got
    to evaluate to decide on a topic and we have much better materials this
    week. I really like the topic I researched, but Anna is pushing for the one
    she took initially. I tried to explain how we could touch on so many
    different areas with mine, but that's exactly why Anna doesn't like it
    &mdash; she thinks that we wouldn't be able to focus ourselves. Kim seemed
    to understand what I'm saying and agreed with me, but Jose supported Anna.
    We went back and forth for most of the meeting and really it was a pretty
    good discussion, but in the end, Anna won Kim over.  </p>

    <p> After the topic was settled, there wasn't much time left, but Anna
    jumped right into drafting an outline, and she wouldn't let anyone else
    help. I suggested something I've used before to try to make the paper
    easier to read, but Anna didn't like it and wanted to go with a more
    conventional approach. She figured that we just didn't know how to write a
    paper, so she spent about ten minutes explaining to us what an outline is
    and why we use it. No one made any comments on the outline after that. </p>

    <p> Jose suggested that we each take a few of our sources, search for more
    on our own and then write up summaries for next week so we're ready for the
    first assignment. Anna agreed and started assigning them out. However, she
    did it like she'd decided that she was the only one with a brain and she
    didn't trust any of the rest of us to get anything right, so she took all
    the materials that were actually interesting and offered any depth &mdash;
    strange, since she made such a big deal out of making sure we were all
    "learning" during the initial research. I wasn't the only one upset &mdash;
    Kim spoke up first to request a specific topic and then Jose and I joined
    in. This clearly irritated Anna, but eventually she gave in and we each
    claimed the ones we most wanted. She still couldn't let go, though, and
    when Jose claimed one that she wanted, she told him she'd "help" him with
    it because it was very complex. He wasn't happy about that. </p>

    <p> I spent about an hour reading, searching and getting started on the
    summaries one night this week, but figured I'd do the rest next week. </p>

- !ruby/object:Week_

  text: |
    <p> I made a mistake. I forgot to finish my summaries until about half an
    hour before our meeting. Not only was I late to the meeting as a result,
    but I didn't have time to finish, either. Jose was just arriving when I
    walked in and Anna got upset with us both for being late, but then she was
    even more upset when we shared our work. Anna wasn't sure who to be more
    upset with: me or Jose. Kim's work was OK, but Jose's were a bit on the
    brief side. However, after she got through my first three summaries, there
    was no hiding the fact that I'd forgot two of them. I apologized and
    explained that I'd had a lot to do for my other classes. Both Kim and Jose
    understood, but Anna just couldn't let it go. </p>

    <p> Then she showed us her pieces which went way beyond "summary" and
    looked like completed portions to be added directly into the paper. She
    asked why we didn't all include pointers to where the summaries should
    ultimately fit in the paper like she did. Kim argued with her on this. She
    asked why Anna's written so much already when we're so early in the
    project. After all, we only have the preliminary structure done and this is
    only the fourth week of class. Anna got upset and asked how anyone would be
    able to put anything together using materials as thin as this.  </p>

    <p> That's when I spoke up. I tried to lighten the mood by pointing out
    that mine wasn't just thin, it was nonexistent, and everyone laughed. It
    wasn't that funny, really, but I think we needed it. I also volunteered to
    assemble next week's assignment, since I still had pieces to do. Finally, I
    tried to move us on by suggesting that we take a look at what we'd got and
    whether or not the outline we put together still fits. The truth is I was
    just trying to get Anna to move beyond the poor quality of everyone's work.
    </p>

    <p> The discussion was OK, and Kim offered some really good ideas about how
    to sequence things. I thought they were good ideas, but we really didn't
    have time to put them together. There was just no way I could get all of
    that done in the next week. However, Anna really liked the idea and started
    getting upset with me for not having time. I know I screwed up this week,
    but does she want me to mess up again next week? Fortunately, Kim stepped
    up and offered to make the changes if I could get the rest of it done by
    the middle of the week. I accepted this and we decided to figure out the
    details after the meeting. </p>

    <p> Naturally, before we left, Anna had to remind everyone that we need to
    keep working on our summaries because we've got the draft due in another
    four weeks. </p>

    <p> After the meeting, Kim asked me to let her know when I was done with my
    part and when I did, she suggested that we meet at the library the next
    evening. We got to talking about the project and other classes. Although
    she's quiet, she seems to notice everything. She even pointed out that she
    liked how my topic idea was turning out &mdash; she noticed that I was
    really the first one to suggest our topic! </p>

    <p> Anyway, we both had time, so we sat down to work together on the
    revisions and it was so easy to work with her. At one point, though, she
    blocked what I thought was a good idea, asking if I thought I could
    convince Anna to go along with it. It's annoying, but she was right. We
    finished the writing much quicker than I'd expected &mdash; maybe an hour
    or so.  </p>

    <p> All told, I think I spent about two and a half hours on this outside of
    our weekly meeting. </p>

    <p> Kim had our assignment ready and turned it in during class. The
    instructor allowed some time at the end of class this week, so we all
    reviewed what she and I put together. Anna was pleased with what we'd done,
    so the meeting went pretty smoothly. </p>

    <p> Kim and I arrived a couple of minutes early for our meeting and we were
    joking, but then Anna showed up and we got down to business. After working
    with Kim last week, I really see how the paper is taking shape. I suggested
    that maybe we further build out our summaries into the paper. Anna just
    looked at me like I was dumb and said that we had to break it up into
    quarters because each of the summaries would be represented in multiple
    places in our outline. I thought we weren't quite ready to start on the
    actual paper yet, but I couldn't explain that and she'd already decided,
    anyway.  </p>

    <p> That's when Jose showed up and said we should take the week off! He
    argued that we had to wait for the instructor's feedback. Kim and I
    jokingly encouraged him, but I don't think he thought it was a joke. I'm
    pretty sure Anna didn't, either, because she got very upset and spent the
    next ten minutes explaining that the instructor probably would barely look
    at our papers, much less provide meaningful feedback. She pointed out that
    it'd probably be weeks before we got anything back and by that point we'd
    have no time left to get our draft together. She kept on about how we
    couldn't stop now because we'd want to take a break later during midterms.
    She was right about all of it, of course, but Jose was really disappointed.
    He said he'd be late next week either way because of practice. </p>

    <p> We split the paper up into quarters and each took a section to write up
    for next week. </p>

    <p> My section was supported by some of my own summaries, as well as a lot
    of Anna's work and some of Kim's. I have to admit that Anna's a good
    writer. She really made it easy for me to put things together with her
    notes and pointers. She provided a nearly-complete set of instructions for
    me to follow in building out the paper. It's like she's known exactly how
    this paper would look from the very beginning.  </p>

    <p> I had some ideas for diagrams that would help to make some things
    clearer, so I went ahead and drafted them. I spent a lot of time on this
    because I sort of get absorbed in trying to make my art perfect. As a
    result, I probably spent about two and a half hours on everything together.

    <p> Kim and I arrived at around the same time for the meeting this week.
    Anna got there a few minutes later and we reviewed our work. Kim had done
    well with her piece and we spent a long time talking about some of her
    observations and what they could mean in other parts of the paper. My
    writing is nowhere near as good, but Anna was distracted by the images I
    included. I have to admit that I'm pretty proud of them. We spent some time
    looking through Anna's and Kim's pieces, trying to come up with visuals
    there, too. Kim said that she'd add a chart using some of her data, but
    Anna told me to do it.  </p>

    <p> At first I was happy because I had fun with them, but Kim responded
    that she hadn't done a lot of that sort of thing before and wanted to try
    it even if she then handed it to me to clean up. I thought it was a good
    idea, but Anna seemed not to hear it. She said I should do it because I'm
    good at it &mdash; but it didn't feel like a compliment. It feels like
    that's all I'm good for. I thought it should all be shared around, anyway?
    How else is everyone going to learn? </p>

    <p> Then Jose arrived and he reminded us that his team was preparing for
    their upcoming game and he'd be late for the next couple of weeks as a
    result. I think he's here on a sports scholarship. Anyway, he was very
    upset when we looked at Anna's changes to his work. I didn't see what he
    gave her, so I'm not sure, but he said she ripped out or rewrote most of it
    and I believe it. She's always telling everyone what to do (he's right) and
    she clearly doesn't think much of him or his work. Anna said she was just
    trying to make sure the paper looks and feels consistent.  </p>

    <p> This time, Jose wasn't backing down, though, and they probably would
    have argued for the rest of the meeting, but Kim spoke up. She commented
    that even though the paper is much different from what she thought it would
    be, it was turning out well. Jose asked us to at least consider including
    the perspective that Anna ripped out, but Anna tore the idea apart as too
    conventional and obvious. She said that we would wind up with just another
    boring paper that anyone could write and that we'd have to spend a huge
    amount of time rewriting the paper that way &mdash; she asked if Jose
    wanted to do a complete rewrite for next week. At this, Jose gave up and we
    decided to keep the paper as she'd written it. We didn't bother looking at
    Jose's work for this week because he would have to make some major changes
    to it, anyway. </p>

    <p> I enjoyed working on images again this week and they all look even
    better now. The team offered good suggestions, but also I had some more
    ideas. I really like doing this kind of work. With that and the substantial
    cleanup I needed to do to the written portion, I probably spent almost
    another hour and a half this week. </p>

    <p> Jose was a little late again when he arrived this week, but this time
    he was visibly limping. I'm not sure if Anna thought he was faking it or
    what, but she asked him to "please try to be on time in the future" in an
    overly polite tone. This set Jose off and he sniped back that it didn't
    matter since she was obviously writing the whole thing herself however she
    wanted. Kim spoke up to calm them both down. She even made everyone,
    including Anna, confirm (out loud) that we are all equals, working on this
    project together. Of course, Anna had to remind us that she had more
    experience than anyone else, but Kim pushed us on anyway. </p>

    <p> Anna was clearly disappointed with my work this week, but it wasn't too
    bad and the images were good. We decided to swap papers with each other to
    proofread them; and she took mine. Everyone was OK with this, but Kim
    wanted to get started on assembling the paper and volunteered to do that,
    as well. At first, Anna said no because it would be tough to match the
    individual pieces with the assembled document so that we could make the
    changes, but Kim said she'd take care of it. </p>

    <p> As we were getting ready to go, Jose asked if anyone would mind
    changing our meeting time for next week &mdash; he has a study session to
    prepare for one of his midterms. I thought that was a great idea I because
    also have midterms coming &mdash; I suggested that we cancel it, since the
    paper is in pretty good shape. Naturally, Anna said no. She said we should
    still meet, but that we can do it briefly, immediately after class to share
    our changes. </p>

    <p> I took Anna's piece and so there wasn't much to clean up (she'd
    probably change it all back, even if I had). I was able to read through it
    quickly. </p>

    <p> During this week's class, some of the discussion touched on the topic
    of our paper and it felt good to be so well prepared. There was some good
    debate about the competing points of view and Jose spoke up a lot. I made a
    few comments, but, as usual, they didn't quite come out right. I could see
    that no one seemed to quite understand what I was saying. I'm not good at
    that sort of thing. </p>

    <p> After class, we met briefly as we decided last week. Kim did a great
    job on the document again; she made a lot of changes on my portion. Jose
    pointed out a problem in with part of my piece, but I didn't get it until
    Anna got impatient and told me I'd forgot one of the diagrams. I had to
    explain that I'd actually spent about half an hour on it and couldn't make
    it work. I'm not actually trained as an illustrator or an artist or
    anything. They were all disappointed, but naturally, Anna just told me to
    try harder. I said I'd try again, but honestly, I don't what more to do.
    </p>

    <p> I asked about our in-class discussion and how we wanted to address that
    in the paper. After all, it was clear that there were multiple points of
    view and we should at least acknowledge them. Anna said those approaches
    were boring and that she wasn't going to throw away a good paper &mdash;
    pointing out that our existing approach showed that we are both creative
    and thoughtful.  </p>

    <p> I agreed with Anna in general, but I pointed out that we need to at
    least acknowledge the in-class conversation. Anna gave in a little bit and
    allowed a brief section, but didn't want Jose to write it because she was
    nervous that his work wasn't very good and we wouldn't have time to clean
    it up by the time the draft is due next week. Jose was offended by this,
    but Kim told Anna she'd review it if Jose could get it to her quickly and
    Anna was OK with that. So Kim asked him to get it to her by mid-week. Jose
    accepted this. </p>

    <p> I spent another half an hour on trying to rework the diagram, but I'm
    sure it's not what Anna wants. </p>

    <p> Kim had our paper ready to be submitted when she arrived in class, and
    she also brought a copy for each of us to review. I had to leave right
    after class, but I took a look that evening and it looked good to me. </p>

    <p> Later in the week, Jose and I got to talking after a class we share,
    and he told me that this week's meeting would start about ten minutes late.
    Unfortunately, it seems that no one mentioned this to Anna. She was getting
    ready to leave when we arrived. She's usually very serious, but this week
    she seemed to be even more uptight and stressed &mdash; she was probably
    really angry. </p>

    <p> Anna had a long list of changes to the paper and some of them were
    pretty big, but no one said anything &mdash; I know I felt guilty and I
    imagine everyone else did, too. She told us all to take another look at the
    whole paper and read it straight through for next week to make sure we
    haven't missed anything and no one argued. </p>

    <p> Our next task was to begin preparing for the presentation. Anna drafted
    a PowerPoint for us to use and then assigned slides to each of us. At one
    point, she asked if anyone was upset with their piece and I think everyone
    was afraid to make her mad, so she kept going. Then she told us we needed
    to write up our talking points for each of our slides and to practice a few
    times in front of a mirror for next week &mdash; like we're all children
    who have never presented anything before. </p>

    <p> I think the images do a pretty good job of communicating the main
    ideas, so I used some of them as the basis for my slides. Since am pretty
    comfortable with my topic, I didn't bother with any notes. </p>

- !ruby/object:Week_

  text: |
    <p> Wow! Maybe I should have practiced a bit? While everyone liked my use
    of images, they basically said that I focused on them and didn't explain
    the topics well. No one else did a great job, either &mdash; including
    Anna. She had a bunch of things to fix and Jose seemed to be almost happy
    to be able to criticize her for a change. She didn't like that at all and
    asked if he was trying to make the presentation better or make her feel
    bad. He shut up after that.  </p>

    <p> Even after three practice runs together, everyone took home a list of
    things to work on to fix their presentations. Kim's was probably the best
    of all, but she spoke very quietly to her notes in her own hands, rather
    than to the audience. </p>

    <p> I actually spent an hour and a half reworking my part &mdash; and then
    about half an hour more practicing it (in front of a mirror). </p>

    <p> In class, the instructor returned the drafts to the groups and our team
    met briefly during class to review it. The instructor left only six
    comments in our paper, and most of them were pretty small, but one
    complimented my images. The only other one that seemed significant asked us
    to further develop a section. </p>

    <p> Our meeting opened with another fight between Anna and Jose. Jose
    interpreted one of the comments to mean that he should write more in the
    section about alternative perspectives, and Anna disagreed. Anna talked
    down to him a lot and told him why he couldn't be right, and that just kept
    making him angrier, but it was clear that he couldn't win. I didn't want
    him to win either, because it would mean rewriting the whole paper. Jose
    finally gave up, and Anna said she'd make the changes the instructor
    requested this week. </p>

    <p> The presentations were better this week, but we still need more
    practice and rework. Anna had improved upon her presentation significantly
    since last week. I don't know how she did it, but it sounded perfect.  </p>

    <p> We also talked about how we should dress for the presentation. Kim had
    a cool costume idea that was in line with our topic that Jose and I both
    liked, but Anna said it was unprofessional. She said we had to wear
    business attire so we would look professional. When we ended the meeting,
    Anna reminded everyone that our presentation is in just two weeks. </p>

    <p> I had a few small changes to make and did a few practice runs this
    week, but probably not more than 45 minutes. </p>

    <p> We had to start without Kim this week because she left a message with
    Jose that she'd be late due to a meeting for another class. We spent some
    time reviewing Anna's changes to the paper, and then she asked me about an
    incorrect reference that the instructor found. I've got to be honest, I am
    amazed that the instructor noticed it. I explained that it was just a
    placeholder I threw in while he was writing.  </p>

    <p> Kim arrived just as Anna finished looking at the changes. Kim asked us
    to take another look, but Anna told her to look at it after the meeting,
    instead. Although it didn't seem like anyone made many changes, the
    presentation felt much better this week. After two practice runs, we
    sounded smooth. While it's still running too long, we agreed that everyone
    will probably speak faster in class and the instructor probably won't be a
    stickler on time. </p>

    <p> We decided we could finish early this week, but before we ended, Anna
    reminded everyone to wear formal business clothes to the presentation next
    week. </p>

    <p> I practiced once this week with a friend, but mostly I focused on my
    other coursework. </p>

    <p> We were the only group where everyone looked professional, and I think
    that probably earned us some points. Everyone spoke loudly and clearly
    enough that the instructor only had to ask Kim to speak up once. Jose
    stumbled on his first few sentences, but then he relaxed and I think it
    came out well, overall. I went last and I added an analogy at the end that
    I think tied things together nicely, and it made everyone laugh. There
    weren't a lot of questions for us and naturally, Anna stepped forward to
    answer them. </p>

    <p> I think we can expect positive feedback and good grades. </p>

    <p> Since the paper is mostly finished, we all decided to cancel this
    week's meeting and instead each give the paper one last review for next
    week. Anna told us to read through the paper one more time to make sure we
    had everything, but we've all got finals to prepare for. </p>

    <p> At the final meeting, we compared notes and found that we had no major
    changes to make. Kim took all four versions and said she'd make what few
    changes there were and submit it at the end of the week. Anna asked her to
    send it to her first, because I guess she doesn't completely trust her. Kim
    was annoyed by this, but said she'd do it. </p>

    <p> As far as I know, the paper went in on time as planned and I imagine
    we'll get a good grade. </p>
