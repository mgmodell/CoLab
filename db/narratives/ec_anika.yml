    <p> In group time, we began by setting up weekly team meetings. My group
    members seem to be nice. One of my teammates, Alex, I recognized from one
    of our big lecture courses last semester. One of the others, Lionel, is a
    transfer. The project is pretty big and fairly open-ended, so we
    brainstormed topic ideas for the most of the time. </p>

    <p> I didn't have a whole lot to say, so I mostly listened, but everyone
    else seemed to have a lot of ideas. Natasha's ideas made me laugh. She
    seems to be working hard to think outside the box, and she mostly did it.
    This meant that many of her ideas weren't really useable, but they were fun
    and they seemed to give other people ideas, too. At some point, Lionel
    noticed that no one was taking notes, so we recounted what we could
    remember while he wrote them down, and we discussed those. </p>

    <p> Before the meeting ended, we crossed off the ideas that didn't seem to
    work (this got rid of most of Natasha's) and narrowed the list down to six.
    Alex asked us to look for resources on all the topics so that next week, we
    will report back and select a topic together. </p>

    <p> When I started looking for reference materials, I got off on a tangent.
    I wound up spending two hours on the task and found a bunch of materials,
    but most of them were for just one topic. I don't think they'll really work
    for what we need. </p>

    <p> Alex, Lionel and Natasha all focused on the same two topics, and
    everyone agreed that the topic I'd done the most work on wasn't really
    viable. We ended up with a lot of duplication &mdash; especially between
    Alex and Natasha &mdash; but they all seemed to have a pretty good handle
    on both topics. Our discussion quickly centered on our most promising two
    topics. </p>

    <p> There was a lot of discussion about which to choose &mdash; everyone
    had an opinion. Then Natasha suggested that we try to combine them. That
    didn't really work, but I think it helped us to see them a bit differently
    before we settled into making decisions. Our first vote split evenly down
    the middle, so Alex made a list of pros and cons. It helped to put things
    in perspective. Our next vote was unanimous. As Alex pointed out, the other
    topic, although more exciting on the surface, would have probably been much
    more complicated and difficult. </p>

    <p> The obvious next step was to find more materials on our selected topic,
    so we figured out the major subtopics and divided them amongst ourselves.
    We decided everyone would return next week with summaries of what they'd
    found to make it easier for the group to get moving quickly. To make sure
    we didn't wind up with a million competing summaries for the many duplicate
    materials, Alex thought to split up the materials we'd already got among
    us. </p>

    <p> I found some more materials that week, then I wrote my summaries. I
    probably spent an hour on this class work. </p>

    <p> During our meeting, we began sorting through the materials. Lionel's
    and Natasha's materials were in good shape. Natasha made me laugh when she
    misread one of my summaries and shone a completely different light on it.
    It turned into an interesting suggestion, too.  </p>

    <p> Natasha's contributions were solid, and we didn't spend too much time
    on them, but Alex's summaries were confusing and no one understood them. He
    had to explain what he meant a lot of the time. That frustrated Lionel and
    Natasha.  </p>

    <p> We then looked at my summaries, and they didn't think I'd written
    enough. I thought that I'd written everything that was necessary and I
    thought they were upset that I didn't pretty it up, but then Alex asked me
    flat out if I'd prefer to use Natasha's summaries or my own to write the
    paper; that's when I got it.  </p>

    <p> I had only been thinking about doing this for the assignment due in two
    weeks because I don't do summaries like this myself, but I guess that's
    sort of a waste of time, isn't it? If we're to get a good grade here, we'll
    all need to help each other out, won't we? I did feel a bit stupid, but he
    was right. Fortunately, we all have things to do to improve our work for
    next week. </p>

    <p> I spent an hour cleaning up and filling out my summaries to be as
    complete as Natasha's. </p>

    <p> My mom has been ill for some time, and I found out that she was in
    hospital, so I drove back home to see her. The doctors took two days to
    figure out what it was and it wound up a false alarm. I headed back to
    school when they said they were comfortable with discharging her and,
    honestly, that was the first time I even thought about this project. </p>

    <p> When I got back to town, I emailed the group to apologize and I sent
    out my summaries. I don't know why I didn't think to do that before I left,
    but I just didn't. I hope they aren't too upset, but I haven't heard
    anything back from any of them. </p>

    <p> Lionel turned in our assignment this week in class, and our instructor
    gave us some time to meet as a group. We spent the time looking at the
    outline Alex put together, since no one else had brought anything with
    them. Alex seemed to be satisfied with it, but Natasha and I weren't. We
    didn't really have much time to get into it, though. </p>

    <p> At our meeting, it took a while to really understand where we weren't
    connecting. I thought that Natasha and I both wanted the same thing, but it
    turns out we had completely ideas of where this was going! Alex, Natasha
    and I talked for half an hour, but I think Lionel was afraid to say
    anything. We ultimately sort of settled on Natasha's plan and modified the
    outline Alex had put together to look more like what she was describing. I
    still think my idea was better, but hers wasn't bad. I could see that I
    wasn't convincing anyone, so I went along with it. </p>

    <p> With the outline settled, I suggested we split the outline up into
    quarters and each write one for next week. Lionel spoke up quickly for the
    second section. Natasha grabbed the first part, and I took the last. That
    left the third part for Alex. </p>

    <p> It took me an hour and a half to see that this approach just wouldn't
    work. We would have to go back and do it the way I thought at first, so I
    stopped about mid-way through and started working on a version that went
    the way I thought it should. I had a lot of other work for this week,
    though, so I didn't get very much of that done. I figure I'll still be
    ahead of everyone else, anyway. </p>

    <p> I was right &mdash; no one was really able to make the pieces work
    quite right, so we had to rethink our approach. When I asked that we look
    at my idea from last week again, though, Alex had also been thinking about
    it and found that we'd run into the same problems that way. Lionel
    suggested that we try something he had used on a past project; it was a
    really good idea. It would, of course, require some adaptation, but it
    could work out very well for us.  </p>

    <p> It was quite exciting, and we all worked on ironing it out together.
    Lionel seemed to be nervous about suggesting anything, but he contributed.
    About halfway into our meeting, we started looking back at the pieces we'd
    already written to see if/where they still fit. It looked like we would be
    left with about half a paper still to write. </p>

    <p> This time, we each claimed pieces that were left to write. For some
    reason, Natasha wanted one of the tricky bits that I spoke for. She didn't
    have any real reason for wanting it, except that I think she wanted to
    offload a boring piece. I traded her one of my other fun parts, though, for
    the boring bit. Everyone was happy (I think)! </p>

    <p> I wound up spending an hour on the tricky piece alone. I was proud of
    it when I was done, but I still had other parts to do. I wound up spending
    an hour and a half more over the course of the week before I was ready for
    our meeting. </p>

    <p> Everyone else was late for our meeting this week. I guess that they all
    had mid-term study sessions today, and they all forgot to mention it last
    week. Kind of annoying, but there was nothing to be done about it. Alex
    didn't arrive for half an hour! </p>

    <p> I didn't stay upset for long, though. Everyone had done their part for
    the week and, after running through what we had, the paper was starting to
    look pretty good. We spent much of our time assembling the pieces into a
    single paper. When we did, we realized that neither the introduction nor
    the conclusion worked very well any longer. Natasha asked Lionel to write
    the introduction, because the new structure of the paper was his idea, but
    he claimed that it really wasn't his idea and didn't feel up to it. Alex
    pushed this, though, and I volunteered to review it if he was concerned;
    that seemed to satisfy Lionel. He said he'd do it, but he made me promise
    that I'd review it the following week &mdash; I thought this was odd,
    because I'd already volunteered to do it, but of course I promised I would.
    </p>

    <p> Alex volunteered to rework the conclusion, but Natasha asked him
    instead to proofread and format the document while she rewrote the
    conclusion. He's not a very good writer. This left me without anything to
    do for class for the week and I felt bad, so I said I'd proofread the
    document, as well, to have an extra set of eyes on it. Before we ended the
    meeting, Natasha told us she'd be late next week because one of her
    midterms would run until the start of this meeting. </p>

    <p> Proofreading took me awhile. It's a good paper, but it's been written
    by four different people. After an hour, I felt I'd improved it
    significantly. </p>

    <p> While Alex may not be good at making sure he puts all the right detail
    in himself, he is good at making sure everyone else does. He found all
    sorts of issues all over the paper &mdash; much more than I found. There
    were a few items I'd got that he didn't, but he did a much more thorough
    job than I'd done. Most of the issues were pretty small, but a few would
    have to wait for after we turn in the draft next week. We will be able to
    rewrite it, but everyone has tight schedules this week.  </p>

    <p> We next looked at Lionel's introduction; it was incredibly short. I
    asked him why and he just shrugged, so there was nothing to do but to read
    it. I probably shouldn't have said anything before I read it because he
    managed to cover all the bases in about half the word count than what I
    could write.  </p>

    <p> Neither Natasha nor Alex had any ideas for improving it, but I was
    still uncomfortable with it being so short. I told them that, although he
    was right and everything necessary was in there, I was still uncomfortable
    with it being so short. The others nodded a bit &mdash; they didn't argue.
    I made a couple of suggestions and so did Natasha. It didn't really add
    anything, but it made me feel better. Alex cut some of it back down again,
    but I think we all felt good about it. </p>

    <p> When we were done, I said I'd add in the conclusion, make the changes
    we talked about and have a version of the paper ready to turn in next week
    in class. Natasha said that she'd try to make the larger changes that Alex
    had suggested. Lionel volunteered to start building a PowerPoint for the
    upcoming presentation. Alex asked if anyone minded if he didn't do anything
    this week because he has a late midterm next week in his toughest subject.
    </p>

    <p> It only took me half an hour to get through everything this week, but
    then I took another half hour reviewing it since we'd be submitting it.
    When I was done, I made sure I had copies for everyone to review, in
    addition to the one for the instructor. </p>

- !ruby/object:Week_
  week_num: 9
  text: |
    <p> We were happy to have copies to look at, but our instructor didn't give
    us any group time in class, so it wasn't as helpful as I'd hoped it would
    be. It did mean we didn't need to waste our meeting time on reading through
    it, though.  </p>

    <p> Natasha merged her changes into this latest version, which she brought
    to our meeting. She'd had a difficult time making those changes, however,
    and they were not complete. She brought a list of questions and possible
    answers, and we spent twenty minutes on that before we came to any answers.
    </p>

    <p> Alex was pretty quiet during most of the discussion, but suddenly he
    said he had an idea after seeing something that Natasha had done. He tried
    to explain it, but I think he saw that we weren't quite understanding, and
    he asked if he could take it home to work on it for next week. I was
    hesitant because he doesn't usually explain his own ideas well, but I said
    OK. We still have time in case it requires too much cleanup. In fact,
    everyone was OK with it. </p>

    <p> We next discussed the presentation &mdash; beginning with the
    PowerPoint Lionel had put together. Lionel emphasized that this was just a
    start and that he knew there wasn't much in it. He recommended that
    everyone claim a few slides and modify them when they worked on what they
    were going to say. Natasha spoke for a few slides, including the first one,
    but this time Lionel said he wanted to introduce us. I was surprised,
    because I didn't figure he'd volunteer for such a visible role. We
    ultimately decided that they'd both give it a shot and see which one we'd
    all like best when we practice next week. </p>

    <p> I didn't spend too much time on this this week. I didn't take that much
    on because I had a lot of work for my other classes. I don't think anyone
    noticed, but my parts were pretty simple. </p>

    <p> Everyone's presentations were pretty good, except for Lionel's. I don't
    know what was going on there! It looked like this was his first time
    building a PowerPoint, and he spent all his time playing with his new toy!
    There were animations, images and words flying in and out. Every slide was
    completely different, too. The worst part was that he just read all the
    words off the slides! We all had a lot of feedback for him &mdash; to be
    fair, there was a lot of feedback for everyone, but with him it wasn't
    nit-picky; it was pretty major.  </p>

    <p> I think maybe we were a bit too harsh, because he was really down
    afterwards. We should have been gentler with him; although he's really
    bright, he doesn't seem to know it. I could see on his face that he took it
    really hard, but I just couldn't keep my mouth shut. I wasn't the only one,
    but I was probably the harshest. I really did try to be constructive, but
    it probably didn't come out that way.  </p>

    <p> Needless to say, it wasn't much of a competition. Natasha's
    introduction was much better than his, so she's going to present it. I
    think she might use some of his visual ideas, though &mdash; it looks like
    he spent a bunch of time cropping our heads for the main slide, and it was
    actually pretty nice (if also a bit cheesy). </p>

    <p> I spent some time practicing and applying the feedback this week, but
    that didn't take too long. </p>

    <p> In class, the instructor returned the drafts, and we met briefly during
    class to review it. There weren't many comments. Most of them were pretty
    minor or issues that Natasha had already fixed. There was one comment that
    concerned us all, though: a diagram might help here. We were presenting our
    instructor with a great big wall of text! How did we miss that? We'd
    definitely have things to talk about at this week's team meeting. </p>

    <p> Lionel arrived a bit late as we were talking about our complete lack of
    images. While we were still at the complaining-about-it stage, though, he
    was way ahead of us. He actually apologized as he pulled out a bunch of
    sketches he'd "thrown together." They were a great start. Natasha quickly
    copied them over with black pen on full sheets so they were crisper and
    easier to see. We worked on them for half an hour, making small changes
    here and there. Natasha volunteered create new versions to include in the
    paper. </p>

    <p> We spent the rest of the meeting working through the presentation.
    Everyone sounded better this week &mdash; especially Lionel. It was like he
    was a completely different person. We all commented on the dramatic
    improvement. I'm not sure he quite believed it, but there was some relief
    on his face, and I felt better. He was also more active in providing
    feedback to everyone else. He pointed out that Alex had included something
    that wasn't actually in our paper. Alex told him where he'd found it and
    Lionel seemed glad, but not satisfied. He asked if we wanted to talk in the
    presentation about something that we didn't mention in the paper. I didn't
    think it was a big deal because it was true, but he clearly felt like it
    was a bad idea and he wouldn't let it go.  </p>

    <p> He wasn't telling Alex to take it out &mdash; he was asking where we
    should add it to the paper. I still didn't want to waste time on it because
    I thought it was fine, but he offered to make the change, so we said OK.
    </p>

    <p> I practiced some more for the presentation, but mostly left this class
    alone because I'm pretty sure we are in good shape. The biggest comment
    they'd all had for me was that I was speaking too fast, so I worked on
    slowing it down. </p>

- !ruby/object:Week_

  text: |
    <p> Lionel's images really added a lot to our paper. They would really make
    it easier for people to understand parts of it. Lionel also claimed one of
    the images for one of his slides. It worked much better than the bullet
    points he'd had on there. I still can't believe we didn't have any images
    in at all until now. </p>

    <p> The presentation was much better this week. After another three
    practice runs, it sounded smooth. I felt bad for Lionel, though, because
    after last week's discussion, Alex had second thoughts and removed the
    controversial bit of his presentation, but he didn't think to let Lionel
    know, so Lionel had still added it to the paper. I could see how frustrated
    Lionel was, but he didn't say anything at all about it. It was actually
    difficult to keep from laughing about it, but I am pretty sure no one would
    have liked that very much.  </p>

    <p> Natasha added the photos of us to her introduction slide, and they
    looked pretty good. Finally, and arguably most importantly, we managed to
    cut it down to the correct time. </p>

    <p> I practiced a few more times during the week when I was able to find a
    moment here and there. </p>

    <p> The presentation went OK, but not quite as smoothly as I'd hoped. Alex
    seemed nervous and got quieter than I'd have liked, but I'm pretty sure
    that most people heard him. They told me that, despite my efforts to avoid
    doing so, I raced through my presentation. We wound up finishing up about
    30 seconds early.  </p>

    <p> Our classmates asked some good questions, which showed that our
    presentation was decent (because they understood at least enough to ask
    questions). Since I spoke last, it seemed natural that I would direct
    questions to the rest of the team (the ones who seemed to know those topics
    best), and that worked quite well. There weren't a lot of questions, but
    enough.  </p>

    <p> We probably should have discussed clothes beforehand. Lionel wore
    slacks and a sports jacket, and Natasha wore a dress skirt and blouse. Alex
    and I were dressed very casually, and it was a bit uncomfortable. </p>

    <p> Generally, though, I think we felt good about the work we'd done. I
    expect positive feedback and good grades. </p>

    <p> We only met briefly this week because we were mostly finished, and we
    all had finals to study for, but Alex said that he had time to go through
    the paper once more. Quite frankly, he's the best person to do it, so no
    one disagreed. We also agreed that we'd only meet briefly next week to make
    sure Alex didn't find any huge problems. </p>

    <p> At the final meeting, we reviewed the paper to make sure it was ready
    for submission at the end of the week. As we went through it, I took issue
    with a few of the changes Alex made. The language he used was a bit
    ambiguous, and it could be read to mean the opposite of what we intended. I
    had to explain it a few times and it took them a while to see it, but
    eventually they did. They agreed that it needed to be fixed.  </p>

    <p> Alex offered to fix it, but I said I'd do it because everyone else had
    a hard time seeing it to begin with. It really only made sense for me to do
    it, but I was nervous about making a change and turning it in without
    everyone getting a chance to see it (we figured there wasn't enough time
    for me to make the changes and get an OK  from everyone in time). They all
    said I should just go ahead and do it, though, so I took it. </p>

    <p> I worked on it that night and I could have sent it out, but figured it
    would be best to proofread the whole thing the next day. I sent it out to
    the team the next night and I got responses the following morning. I
    actually managed to send the paper in a bit early as a result! </p>
