    <p> In group time the first week, we began by setting up weekly team
    meetings. The project is fairly open-ended, so we brainstormed topic ideas
    for the rest of the time. </p>

    <p> Iain had some really good ideas &mdash; it seems he's done this sort of
    thing before. I only had a couple of ideas and none of them are as good as
    his, but I volunteered both of them anyway. When Marie spoke, I wasn't sure
    if she was serious or not. Her suggestions were usually funny &mdash; but
    I'm not sure they were meant to be. She definitely has a unique approach.
    Hannah mostly just listened throughout &mdash; maybe she's shy. We built on
    each other's suggestions (mostly Iain's). </p>

    <p> Before the meeting ended, we narrowed it down to three ideas, and Marie
    recommended we each look for resources on one topic to report back next
    time and select a topic. This seemed like a pretty good approach, and we
    all agreed. Iain spoke first to claim one topic based upon a prior
    interest. I spoke up next for another topic because I'd heard of it before
    and had an idea of where to look. No one challenged me, so it's mine. After
    some consideration, Marie spoke next, and that left Hannah without a topic,
    so we decided she should search for additional materials on Iain's topic.
    She seems nice but hasn't said very much. </p>

    <p> After the meeting, I did some quick searches and turned up some
    promising materials for the following week. I feel pretty good about being
    able to contribute next week. </p>

    <p> Hannah started getting upset because she had found few materials and
    complained that it was too difficult. Before I had a chance to speak, Iain
    pointed out that he'd gotten more than enough to start with and even
    volunteered to explain to Hannah how he searched, so she would have a
    better idea for the future. </p>

    <p> After reviewing the topics and materials everyone found, there was a
    lot of discussion around which topic to choose. Everyone had an opinion.
    Marie led the group in writing out lists of pros and cons, and ultimately
    the group held a vote and decided on the topic I researched. I was excited
    about that, because it seemed the most promising and most of the group
    agreed. However, it wasn't the one Iain was pushing for, and he seemed
    grumpy afterward. </p>

    <p> The materials I found were just the beginning, so the group divided the
    topic into subtopics and we each took a few. Hannah and Iain planned to
    meet separately so Hannah could learn some of Iain's research strategies.
    We plan to have summaries of what we've found for next week so we are ready
    for the next assignment. </p>

    <p> I spent about two hours working on my task for the group. </p>

    <p> We began our meeting by sorting through the materials. Together, Iain
    and Hannah were able to collect some quality materials and the summaries
    they've written help Marie and I to understand their value quickly. Clearly
    they've put a lot of effort into the task. I felt bad when my turn came
    because, by comparison, I had to spend more time helping the team to
    understand what I found &mdash; I did write them all alone, though. I was
    pretty sure the group mostly understood, but I told them I'd rewrite the
    summaries to make them clearer, and they were visibly relieved. Oops. </p>

    <p> Marie's summaries were somewhat better than mine, but I don't see how
    most of them relate. They are interesting and some are funny, but how do
    they fit in? Iain and Hannah seemed to be confused &mdash; it wasn't just
    me. None of us knew how to respond, but after some awkward moments, Iain
    laid out a few direct questions and I would swear I saw a light bulb go on
    over Marie's head. Somehow, the way he asked those questions, she didn't
    seem to get upset at all! We all decided that there's plenty of time and
    that we can wait to meet again next week to review the updated materials
    from Marie and I. </p>

    <p> I spent about two hours rewriting my summaries and even getting some
    more materials. Maybe it wasn't the most productive time, but I really
    didn't want to be embarrassed again, and I kept losing my focus. </p>

    <p> I spent another hour reviewing all the materials and proofreading my
    work prior to the meeting. Iain was late by about five minutes, but Hannah
    was not in class at all and had not arrived at our meeting by the time Iain
    did. No one had heard anything from her, and she was unreachable using any
    of the contact information she provided. </p>

    <p> We went ahead and started without Hannah and began working through
    Marie's updated materials, and Iain and I became concerned.  After a few
    more discussions that were reminiscent of last week, Iain pushed us to move
    on; I was happy to join that effort. Marie, though a little confused, went
    with it. Much less time was needed for my materials because I had improved
    them a great deal.  Going into the fifth week, I said I'd put together what
    we've got for our first assignment. Iain also pushed for us to get started
    on an early draft, and we split up the tasks of synthesizing sections of
    the paper. </p>

    <p> Iain caught me outside after the meeting broke up and expressed his
    concerns about Marie and Hannah. We discussed the possibility of talking to
    the instructor, but decided to wait for a bit longer since it was only the
    fourth week. Iain thought we could still use some of Marie's resources, and
    I volunteered to proofread (i.e. rewrite) her summaries, while Iain offered
    to search for additional content. </p>

    <p> I had to spend two nights making sense of those summaries and drafting
    my portion of the paper. </p>

    <p> I turned in our assignment during class and it felt good to know that
    we were on track. Our instructor gave us some of time in class to meet, and
    we discussed our progress, but none of us expected to have this time, so no
    one brought their materials to review. I was mostly finished with my
    portion already and it had gone pretty smoothly. Either everyone else was
    in the same position or they hadn't started working on theirs. Either way,
    it was a bit of a waste of time. </p>

    <p> Hannah was back for the meeting this week and wearing a cast. She
    slipped on some ice the weekend before and landed in the hospital for
    almost a week. She did bring a first draft of the section that was assigned
    to her in her absence (I emailed meeting notes to the whole group last
    week). </p>

    <p> Iain was noticeably less enthusiastic this week than he has been in the
    past, and seemed to be less patient with Marie. Also, his draft doesn't
    look like he put much thought into it. There are a number of spots that
    read "to be determined," and I didn't see any citations anywhere. Marie was
    clearly nervous when the group reviewed her work, but I was actually
    impressed with how much she seems to have improved. That must have shown on
    my face because she seemed to relax after she looked at me. Hannah and I
    both pointed out a number of rough spots, but I was no longer nervous that
    Marie was struggling. Hannah explained that her own work was incomplete,
    and it clearly was, but (given the circumstances) everyone was just
    impressed that she'd done anything. The hours I spent writing paid off, as
    mine was easily the most complete. Usually Iain has a lot to say, but this
    week he was really quiet. </p>

    <p> Marie suggested we each hand off our portion to another team member for
    a more thorough review and I volunteered to take Iain's because I knew it
    would need work. He, in turn, claimed mine, but Hannah wanted to take more
    time to finish her own section. Marie, reminding us of Iain's early,
    insightful comments, asked that he look at her work. Marie took mine. Wow!
    They were all fighting to take my work! </p>

    <p> I spent a lot of time reworking Iain's paper. The language was clear
    and readable, but the sections felt thin. In fact, I grew one section so
    much that it had to be split out into two. Also, there were only two
    citations listed and one of them was wrong. It's pretty bad and I'm sure he
    could have done better than this. </p>

    <p> Iain was in class this week, but he emailed the team about an hour and
    a half before the meeting to say that there was a family emergency and that
    he would not be able to make the meeting. He sent over his progress on
    Marie's part of the paper &mdash; and it didn't look he'd done much more
    than make the few changes we discussed in class last week. </p>

    <p> The meeting was fairly productive and I felt like I could see the paper
    starting to take shape. Marie took an odd approach to revising my section;
    I think she didn't really understand it. Hannah seemed to agree with me,
    and Marie quickly said she'd go ahead and change it back. The three of us
    spent awhile talking about how satisfied we were with the topic. Feeling
    like much of the paper was in good shape, Hannah took the pieces home to
    assemble them into a full draft to use moving forward. </p>

    <p> Before the meeting ended, I asked about switching next week's meeting
    time so I could meet with another study group &mdash; I really need to
    prepare for a mid-term exam the following week. After some discussion, we
    couldn't agree on a new time, so we decided instead to meet only for half
    an hour. Marie sent an email to let Iain know of the change. </p>

    <p> This week turned out to be very busy, so I'm glad we decided to cut the
    meeting time down. Hannah gave everyone a copy of the document she
    assembled. After about 15 minutes of what was scheduled to be a half-hour
    meeting, Iain had not arrived, so we all decided to walk through what
    Hannah put together. </p>

    <p> Hannah clearly spent a lot of time putting everything together. The
    formatting was consistent and I didn't see anything missing. There's one
    empty section, but she explained that it's because she added it &mdash;
    being the only one who's read it all through, she felt it was necessary. I
    jokingly suggested that Iain should write it; Marie quickly countered
    that'd mean I'd end up writing it, anyway. Hannah interrupted our joking
    and said we were being mean. I think she felt bad because, in the
    beginning, Iain had helped her. She reminded us that he was going through a
    family emergency and maybe he was really shaken up by it. I felt a little
    badly and we all returned to reviewing the document. </p>

    <p> Once we finished walking through the document, we agreed to make
    notes/corrections/suggestions on our own for next week. As we were all
    getting ready to leave, Iain came in the door of the meeting room. Hannah
    quickly asked him if he was doing OK and what was going on &mdash; it
    seemed like she was afraid Marie or I would have said something mean if she
    didn't speak first. He said his brother was going through something that he
    was helping him with. We gave him a copy of the paper, and quickly
    explained what we'd all be doing for next week. </p>

    <p> I only spent about 30 minutes reviewing the document, because I had a
    lot of studying to do for mid-terms, but there is be more work needed
    before this project is ready. </p>

    <p> Everyone was there by the time I arrived this week. My instructor let
    me take a little extra time on my mid-term, which helped me out, but made
    me a little late to the meeting. </p>

    <p> Marie has a great eye for detail &mdash; she found spelling and
    formatting errors that everyone else missed. Hannah volunteered to take
    everyone else's copies and make all the changes for the draft we turn in
    next week in class. When I asked about the section that was still missing,
    Iain said he thought it was too late to get it into the draft. He figured
    it should be fine to include a note that it will be in the final version
    and he made it clear that he wasn't going to do it. I didn't think this was
    OK. Marie agreed, and volunteered to draft the section and get it to Hannah
    by the middle of the week. Honestly, I'm a little nervous about Marie
    writing it, but it was clear that Iain wasn't going to do it, and I really
    need a break from this project. Hannah figured she wouldn't have time to do
    both the editing and the writing, but agreed to add the new content if
    Marie could write it in time. All Iain offered Marie were some (pretty
    good) suggestions on how to approach the new content. </p>

    <p> The next evening, Marie asked if I could come over to help get the
    sections done in time. She was stressed because some surprise assignments
    in other classes gave her less time than she'd expected. I said OK, and
    when we met up, I found that it was much more complicated than it looked.
    Working together, we were able to write a decent draft so she could deliver
    it to Hannah the next day, but it took most of the night. </p>

    <p> Hannah didn't provide copies to everyone before class, and that was
    nerve-wracking, but she did have one to turn in to the instructor. She
    turned it in and now we get to wait for feedback. Of course, we already
    know some of the work that needs done. </p>

    <p> Working with Marie last week, we noticed some problems in the draft
    that will need correcting &mdash; particularly stuff that Iain supposedly
    worked on. It's like he didn't even touch it. Just before Iain left for
    another meeting, Marie suggested we could use some diagrams to illustrate
    some of our points. Iain watched us sketch for a bit before he left. We
    came up with some good ideas and Marie volunteered to draw them out. I
    offered to reread the entire document and the meeting ended a bit early
    because we were mostly done anyway. </p>

    <p> I spent another two and a half hours reworking the document this week.

    <p> Marie and I both arrived early to this week's meeting, and started
    looking at the images she put together over the past week while we waited
    for Hannah and Iain to arrive. The images were a bit odd and I don't think
    some of them are appropriate. When Hannah arrived, she said that Iain had
    let her know he won tickets to the game tonight, and so he couldn't make it
    to our meeting &mdash; nothing new there.  </p>

    <p> Hannah said she really liked the images Marie put together. They
    reflect Marie's quirky personality, but Hannah pointed out that they also
    include the right details to get the point across. She described them as
    functional, eye-catching, and memorable. They are memorable, but I don't
    think that was the goal here. I wish Iain had showed up, because he always
    seems to have a good feel for the project's direction. I'm pretty sure he'd
    agree with me, but I felt outnumbered. I made a few requests to tame them
    down, but ultimately I accepted it, and we moved on. </p>

    <p> I'd made a lot of changes to the document, and some of them were pretty
    big. I walked through them at a high level to make sure everyone agreed
    before starting to prepare for the presentation. We decided on a basic
    structure and, for the next meeting, we decided that we should each put
    together notes or a script for what we would say during our part so we can
    practice it next week. Hannah said she'd pass this on to Iain. </p>

    <p> I've had a difficult time writing my script, so one afternoon I emailed
    Iain to see if we could meet and work on it together. However, when I
    didn't hear back from him, I met up with Hannah instead. After working
    together for an hour, we both made some good progress. </p>

    <p> In class, the instructor returned the drafts to the groups and gave us
    time during class to review it. Unfortunately, while we know there were
    many problems with that version, the instructor left only five comments in
    our paper. One said, "This shows promise," two corrected grammar issues
    that we've already fixed, one requested that page numbers be added, and one
    suggested clarifying one of the sections Marie wrote initially, saying it
    was a novel approach and that it should be explained more clearly and
    thoroughly. </p>

    <p> Everyone arrived on time to the group meeting. The discussion began
    with how little feedback we received, and whether this meant the paper was
    in great shape or that instructor simply didn't really read it. Either way,
    we had the feedback we'd been waiting for, and it was time to move forward.
    </p>

    <p> Marie asked Iain to review her section again, and he answered that he
    had already done so once at her request. Marie responded in a snarky tone
    that she'd like him to "actually read it this time." This became an
    argument, with Marie accusing Iain of not participating in the group. Iain
    attacked back, saying that the low quality of her work made it very
    difficult to work with. That wasn't fair, and I started to defend Marie for
    at least working and trying hard, and showing up, when Hannah raised her
    voice and everyone quieted down. She reminded the group that the
    presentation was coming up soon and that we needed to practice. Iain said
    that, while he wouldn't have time to go through the entire paper, he would
    take a look at Marie's section again before next week. </p>

    <p> The rest of the meeting was spent working through the presentation.
    Marie put together a PowerPoint and we did a practice run. Iain really
    seems to have put a lot of time into his part; he sounded very polished. He
    also had many suggestions for the rest of us, but, honestly, they were hard
    to hear after the argument we just had. By the end of the meeting, the
    presentation was still running too long. I have to make decisions on how to
    cut my part down, but with two weeks left, I feel pretty good about it.
    </p>

    <p> I spent about an hour on revising and cutting content from my
    presentation during the week. </p>

    <p> Everyone arrived on time for the meeting this week. Iain provided
    feedback on Marie's section and, reading through it, it became clear that
    making these changes would require more substantial changes throughout the
    paper. We could easily have just ignored them because what we have is not
    wrong, but making the changes would certainly improve the paper. However,
    so close to the end of this class, I'm not sure we have the time to do this
    &mdash; especially with everyone getting ready for final projects and
    exams. It would have been nice if he'd bothered to read the paper earlier,
    when it would have been easier to make these changes. Why didn't he even
    try to start making them?  </p>

    <p> Hannah said she thought she had time to make the changes this week, and
    volunteered to try if someone else would read through it next week. When no
    one else responded, I volunteered. She's been doing a good job and checking
    it over shouldn't be a huge amount of work, even with all my other
    classwork to prepare. </p>

    <p> This week, the presentation was much better. After three practice runs,
    it sounded smooth. While it was still running a bit too long, we agreed
    that everyone will probably speak faster in class, and the instructor
    probably won't be so strict about timing. </p>

    <p> This week, aside from practicing my part of the presentation, I mostly
    focused on my other classes and end-of-semester activities. </p>

    <p> The presentation went very smoothly. Hannah seemed nervous, spoke too
    quickly, and faced the PowerPoint instead of the class, but she knew what
    she was talking about and that showed. The audience asked some good
    questions, which showed that they understood the presentation, but Iain
    seemed to want to score points by answering most of the questions. I
    started to answer one, but he cut me off and he talked right over me as he
    answered himself. Also, we should have discussed attire beforehand, because
    Iain wore a suit, while Hannah and Marie were both wearing dress skirts and
    blouses. I felt out of place in my usual jeans and a sweater. </p>

    <p> At our meeting this week, everyone commented on my casual clothes and I
    apologized, but I just never thought about it. Aside from that, the group
    felt good about the work we've done, and we all agreed that we expected
    positive feedback and good grades. Hannah shared her updated version of the
    paper and I took it to review (as we had discussed last week).  </p>

    <p> As we were leaving, Marie asked me to send her a copy as soon as I
    finished reviewing Hannah's corrections, so she could take another look at
    it. I spent about an hour reading through the new version, but I only made
    a few changes and then sent it on to Marie. </p>

    <p> At the final meeting, we reviewed the paper to make sure it was ready
    for submission at the end of the week. Iain volunteered to do a final read,
    print the document and send it to the instructor. Marie started to attack
    Iain for not helping the group &mdash; I think she felt like he was trying
    to steal credit for all our work at the end &mdash; just like he did with
    the presentation. I was too tired for that, though, and I just wanted the
    project to be over, so I tried to calm her down and Hannah joined me. I
    suggested that Marie submit the latest version she had at the deadline, and
    if Iain was able to get her his updates by that time, they'd go in;
    otherwise, she should use what she had &mdash; Marie would send it in. Iain
    was annoyed, but agreed. </p>

    <p> After the deadline, Marie confirmed that Iain got his changes to her in
    time for her to submit them, and she sent a copy of the finished product to
    the entire group. </p>
