    <p> In group time the first week, we began by setting up weekly team
    meetings. The rest of the group seem to be freshmen. They're all so nervous
    about this "huge project" but, as a junior, I know it's not that big of a
    deal. I just hope that I don't wind up getting stuck rewriting the project
    at the last minute after they mess everything up. </p>

    <p> The project was fairly open-ended, so we brainstormed topic ideas for
    most of the first meeting. I suggested some of the more obvious topics and
    was a little shocked when they all loved them. John tried to be involved,
    but his suggestions were pretty weak. When Marie spoke, I couldn't tell if
    she was serious or not. Her suggestions were funny, but I'm not sure that
    was her intent. She definitely has a unique approach. Hannah didn't talk
    much. She seemed to be paying attention, but I guess she's shy. Pretty
    soon, everyone built on my suggestions. </p>

    <p> Before the meeting ended, we narrowed it down to three ideas. Marie
    recommended we each look for resources on one topic and then report back
    next time. It seemed like a good idea and everyone else agreed. I spoke up
    quickly for a topic that I've done some work on it in another class &mdash;
    it was also the most interesting. John spoke up for another and, after a
    moment, Marie took the last topic. She didn't sound thrilled about it,
    though. That left Hannah without a topic, so she said she'd search for
    additional materials on my topic. She seems nice, but we'll see where that
    goes. </p>

    <p> The research for this week didn't take very long because I was able to
    use some materials from that previous class. </p>

    <p> Hannah had a breakdown when she arrived because she couldn't find much
    &mdash; she's clearly out of her depth. I pointed out that I'd got more
    than enough to start with and I offered to work with her after the meeting
    to give her some tips and tricks. </p>

    <p> After reviewing the topics and the materials everyone found, there was
    fighting over which topic to focus on. Marie decided to start organizing
    things into lists of pros and cons to make it easier to understand, and
    then the group held a vote. For some reason, the three of them decided to
    go with the topic John had researched &mdash; even though my topic would be
    much easier and isn't boring. This makes no sense at all and this whole
    project's going to be a nightmare. </p>

    <p> The obvious next step was to find more materials, so we divided up the
    major subtopics. We decided everyone would return next week with summaries
    of what they'd found to make it easier for the group to get moving quickly.
    </p>

    <p> I met with Hannah two days later and she's nice and pretty bright. I
    showed her how to pull more keywords out of materials and to look in the
    bibliographies for more ideas. After about two and a half hours, we had
    some solid references. She went through them and wrote summaries, and then
    I verified them. She was probably just overwhelmed at first, because she
    did a pretty good job. Now she's on the right track. </p>

    <p> In this week's meeting, we began sorting through the materials.
    Together, Hannah and I had easily the best materials and summaries, and we
    didn't spend much time reviewing it. John's materials, on the other hand,
    were difficult to understand and his help was required to interpret what he
    meant. He seemed embarrassed and told us he'd rewrite the summaries to make
    them clearer. Marie's summaries were interesting and some of them were
    funny, but I wasn't sure how they fit in. I tried not to look too confused,
    but everyone seemed unsure of how to respond. After some awkward moments, I
    asked her a few direct questions that seemed to help her see what we need.
    The team decided there was still plenty of time, though, and that she could
    take another week to try again. After all, John would be doing the same.
    </p>

    <p> I got to relax this week without any tasks for this project. Looks like
    this project isn't going to take too much of my time after all. That's
    great, because I've got a heavy course load this semester. </p>

    <p> I arrived a little late to the meeting, but Hannah wasn't there at all.
    She wasn't even in class and no one had heard anything from her. The
    instructor would tell us if she dropped the class, right? </p>

    <p> When it looked like she wouldn't be coming, we began working through
    Marie's updated materials. John and I exchanged concerned looks. After a
    few more discussions that were reminiscent of last week, I began pushing to
    move on and John was happy to join that effort. Marie went with it, even
    though she was clearly confused. Much less time was needed for John's
    materials because they were in much better shape now. John volunteered to
    put together what we had for the assignment due next week, and we both
    pushed to get started on an early draft. We split up the tasks of
    synthesizing the sections. </p>

    <p> I caught John outside after the meeting ended, and we discussed Marie
    and Hannah. We discussed the possibility of talking to the instructor, but
    decided to wait another week or so. I think we can probably use some of
    Marie's resources. John volunteered to proofread her summaries and I said
    I'd look for additional content. </p>

    <p> My searching was pretty easy, and I only needed to spend about half an
    hour on both that and summarizing what I'd found. For the first draft of my
    portion of the paper, I spent about an hour writing &mdash; there will be
    plenty of time to fix it up later, and I have other classwork. </p>

    <p> John turned in our assignment during class, and our instructor gave us
    some time in class to meet. We discussed our progress, but none of us
    expected to have this time, so no one brought their materials to review. No
    one seemed to want to be there, so we all left early instead. </p>

    <p> Hannah was back this week and wearing a cast. She slipped on some ice
    and landed in the hospital for a week. Impressively, she brought a first
    draft of the section that was assigned to her when she was out &mdash; John
    emailed meeting notes to the whole group. </p>

    <p> Marie's constant attempts to be weird are really getting on my nerves.
    Also, for some reason, everyone seemed to treat this first draft like it
    was supposed to be the final complete version; everyone was visibly
    disappointed with what I brought, but that's fine. There's lots of time
    left. Marie was clearly nervous when we reviewed her work, but I was
    actually pleasantly surprised by what she'd done. Maybe that showed on
    everyone's faces because when she looked up at us, she seemed to relax.
    John and Hannah both pointed out a number of rough spots, but I'm no longer
    nervous about her ability and she seemed to be visibly relieved. Hannah
    explained that her own work was incomplete, and it clearly was, but she was
    in the hospital. The fact that she brought anything at all was awesome. I
    honestly didn't pay too much attention to John's piece because I figured it
    was probably pretty good. I started thinking about an upcoming quiz in one
    of my more advanced classes. I tried to focus and participate, but they
    didn't really need me there. </p>

    <p> Marie suggested we hand off our portion to another team member for a
    more thorough review, even though I didn't think we were ready for that
    yet. John immediately volunteered to take mine, so I claimed his &mdash; it
    was in pretty good shape already and that'd give me some extra time to
    study for my other classes. Hannah asked for more time to finish her
    section and then Marie specifically asked me to review hers; she took
    John's. I probably should be flattered, but I'd really rather have the time
    instead. </p>

    <p> Marie took some notes on her work before we traded papers, so that made
    it pretty quick and easy to make those changes. I quickly read through the
    whole thing and found that it was kind of a mess. I set it aside so I could
    spend more time on it later in the week when my other work was done. </p>

    <p> The morning of our meeting, I picked up Marie's paper again but I just
    couldn't manage to get through it. It seems that she tried hard to be
    different and come up with a unique perspective, but the end result doesn't
    cover the main points and really doesn't make any sense. Just as I was
    starting to make some sense of what she wrote, my brother asked me to come
    over. He's been having a rough time since his discharge and he told me he
    needed to get out. I emailed the team to let them know I had to take care
    of a family thing, sent them what I had and then I drove back home to see
    him. </p>

    <p> I had a massive headache the next morning, but I knew it'd go away and
    my brother seemed better. Marie had emailed me to let me know they decided
    to cut the next meeting down to only half an hour to give everyone time to
    prepare for mid-terms in other classes. A good idea, but I'd have to really
    rush to make it for a short meeting because one of my own study groups was
    set to end when this one starts &mdash; across campus. As a bonus, though,
    Marie's paper was out of my hands. </p>

    <p> I arrived late because of the study group and Hannah asked if
    everything was OK. I explained that something came up with my brother but
    that he was OK and they gave me a copy of the assembled document &mdash; it
    seems they're further along than I thought! We're all supposed to review
    the whole document for next week. </p>

    <p> The paper looked pretty good, actually. It seems that Hannah put it
    together well and even identified a new section that will need to be
    written, as well as a few other changes here and there. They were good
    ideas, but the new section will certainly have to wait for the final
    version, because there's no way we can get it written and added into the
    draft due in two weeks. All told, I probably spent about half an hour going
    through this version and I didn't have many comments. I didn't spend too
    much time on Marie's work, either. I just didn't have the energy. </p>

    <p> I arrived early this week. They've been making decent progress without
    me though, so it's not a problem. This time John arrived late because his
    exam had run late. </p>

    <p> Marie has a great eye for detail, as she found a ton of spelling and
    formatting errors that everyone else missed. Hannah volunteered to take
    everyone else's copies and make all the changes for the draft that we are
    to turn in next week in class. John pointed out the sections that are still
    missing or incomplete, but I said it's too late to get it into the draft
    and that it should be fine to include a note that it will be in the final
    version. I certainly didn't have the time to write it. The rest of the
    group disagreed with me, though. They decided to try to get it done, and
    Marie volunteered to draft the two sections and get them to Hannah by the
    middle of the week so Hannah could incorporate the changes. I couldn't
    imagine how they can find the time, but I offered Marie some suggestions on
    how to approach the new content, and everyone seemed to value my
    recommendations. </p>

    <p> Fortunately, I managed to get away with no work for this group this
    week because my other classes are keeping me very busy. </p>

    <p> Hannah brought our paper to class and turned it in to the instructor.
    Now we get to wait for feedback while we continue to work. </p>

    <p> John and Marie met last week and worked together; while working through
    it, they noticed a bunch of problems in the draft that will need
    correcting. Many of them were in Marie's work, and she got upset that I
    didn't fix them when she asked me to look at it. Why didn't she write it
    like that in the first place? Eventually, we moved on when Marie suggested
    we add some diagrams to illustrate some of our points. Even though I had to
    go to another meeting, I stuck around a bit while the group sketched some
    ideas. However, I really did have to go and when they seemed to have it
    under control, I left. </p>

    <p> Again, I was lucky not to have much to do in this class this week. </p>

    <p> My buddy offered me his extra seat to the game, and the seats were
    amazing, so I accepted without realizing this was the night of our meeting.
    As soon as I remembered, I let Hannah know I wouldn't be there.  </p>

    <p> When I got back, there was an email from Hannah asking me to look at
    the report with Marie's images. She also asked me to prepare notes or a
    script for my part in the presentation so we can practice together next
    week.  </p>

    <p> The images were odd, but I sort of liked them.  </p>

    <p> Preparing for my part took less than half an hour, so I took some extra
    time and practiced it on a friend. </p>

    <p> In class, the instructor returned the drafts and our team met briefly
    during class to review it. Unfortunately, while we knew there were lots of
    problems with that version, the instructor left only five comments in the
    paper. I guess they expected much of it to change since it was only a
    draft. One read "this shows promise," two corrected grammar issues, one
    requested that page numbers be added and one suggested clarifying some of
    Marie's work. It read that it was a novel approach and that it should
    therefore be explained more clearly and thoroughly. </p>

    <p> During the meeting, we were all on time and the discussion began with
    how little feedback the group got &mdash; we figured that the instructor
    probably didn't really read the whole thing. Either way, we had our
    feedback and it was time to move forward. </p>

    <p> Predictably, Marie asked me once again to review her section. This
    annoyed me because I really don't want to look at it again. Marie pushed
    with a snarky tone that she'd like me to "actually read it this time." Soon
    she was accusing me of not participating. Maybe I was out of line, but I
    responded that the low quality of her contribution made it very difficult
    to work with. John jumped in on Marie's side and then Hannah raised her
    voice and quieted everyone down. She reminded us of the presentation coming
    in two weeks and that yelling at each other wouldn't help us get prepared.
    I said I'd look at Marie's section again for next week. </p>

    <p> We spent the rest of the meeting working through the presentation. We
    used a PowerPoint Marie put together in a practice run. We had to change it
    a bit, but it was nice to have something there to work with. I think my
    section is pretty good and offered a few suggestions for everyone else.
    Even after three rounds of practice and changes, the presentation ran too
    long &mdash; particularly John's part. I suspect he's not very experienced
    at this sort of thing, because he tried to include way too much and said it
    way too fast. However, we still have time. </p>

    <p> I spent about an hour and a half working on Marie's section during the
    week. Unfortunately, it really would have been better to get to this
    earlier because my recommendations will mean changes throughout the paper,
    and I didn't have time to make them all this past week. Why didn't anyone
    else see this? </p>

    <p> Everyone arrived on time for the meeting this week. </p>

    <p> We began by walking through the changes I proposed, making it clear
    that these changes would require larger changes throughout the paper. We
    talked about forgetting them because what we've got is not wrong, but
    everyone agreed that making the changes would give us a stronger paper.
    There just isn't much time &mdash; especially with everyone getting ready
    for their final projects and exams in other classes. Fortunately, Hannah
    volunteered to make the changes this week, if someone else would promise to
    read through it next week to make sure she didn't miss anything. After a
    pause, John volunteered. Good that they stepped up because I don't have
    time for any of this. </p>

    <p> This week the presentation was much better and it sounded smooth. While
    it still ran too long, we agreed that everyone will probably speak faster
    in class, and the instructor probably wouldn't care if we ran over a bit.
    </p>

    <p> I practiced a few more times during the week when I was able to find a
    moment. </p>

    <p> The presentation went very smoothly. Hannah was a bit nervous, but she
    knew what she was talking about and it showed. The audience asked some good
    questions, which showed that they understood our presentation. I answered
    most of the questions that came our way because no one else seemed up for
    it. We should have discussed clothes beforehand, because I came wearing a
    suit, and Marie and Hannah were both wearing dress skirts and blouses. John
    looked out of place in his usual jeans and a sweater. </p>

    <p> I think we'll get positive feedback and good grades. Hannah shared her
    updated version of the paper and after a quick review of the changes, which
    weren't huge. As promised, John took the paper home to review it more
    closely. We ended early because I had to leave for another group and really
    there was not much else to do. </p>

    <p> As we wrapped up, Marie asked John to send her a copy as soon as he's
    finished so she could take one last crack at it. </p>

    <p> At the final meeting, we reviewed the paper to make sure it was ready
    for submission at the end of the week. I volunteered to do a final read,
    print the document and send it to the instructor, but Marie said she was
    not finished with it and that she'd like to take some more time with it.
    She eventually agreed to get it to me the evening of the next day. Hannah
    suggested that I might not have enough time and asked that Marie submit the
    latest version at the deadline. She said that if I was able to get Marie my
    updates by that time, they'd go in, but otherwise we'd send what we'd got.
    I feel like they don't trust me and that's annoying, but I agreed. </p>

    <p> I got Marie the content in plenty of time and she got it in in time.
    She confirmed this and sent a copy of the finished product to the entire
    team. </p>
