    <p> In group time the first week, we began by setting up weekly group
    meetings. The project is fairly open-ended, so we brainstormed topic ideas
    for the rest of the time. </p>

    <p> Iain had some really good ideas &mdash; it seems he's done this sort of
    thing before. John tried to be involved by suggesting a couple of ideas,
    but they were pretty mediocre. I like to look at things from a different
    perspective, so I suggested some things that were not exactly off-topic,
    but not entirely serious, either. However, they seemed to fall completely
    flat; not only didn't they spark conversation, but I didn't even get a
    chuckle. Throughout the meeting, I could tell that Hannah was listening,
    but maybe she's shy, because she didn't say much. Pretty quickly we built
    on Iain's suggestions. </p>

    <p> Before the meeting ended, we narrowed it down to three ideas. I
    recommended that we each look for resources on one topic, report back next
    time and then select one; everyone else agreed. Iain claimed a topic based
    upon a prior interest, and John spoke up for another. I reluctantly
    volunteered for the last topic, leaving Hannah without one. She said she'd
    search for additional materials on Iain's topic. </p>

    <p> I didn't find much on my topic, so I got creative in my interpretation
    it &mdash; hopefully it will at least be good for a laugh. I was
    uncomfortable with what I have, but I know I've tried. </p>

    <p> Hannah was upset because she had found very few materials &mdash;
    complaining that there was nothing to find. Iain pointed out that he had
    more than enough to start with, and even volunteered to explain how he
    searched to Hannah after the meeting, so she would have a better idea for
    the future. </p>

    <p> After reviewing the topics and the materials everyone found, there was
    a lot of discussion around which topic showed the greatest promise. I
    decided to organize what everyone was saying into lists of pros and cons to
    make it easier to understand. The topic I'd looked at was quickly removed,
    but both John's and Iain's looked good. Iain pushed really hard for his
    topic, but I just couldn't seem to get as excited about it. Eventually, we
    held a vote and decided on the topic John had researched. I was pretty
    happy with the decision, but Iain seemed grumpy afterward. </p>

    <p> The materials John had found were just the beginning, so we divided up
    the major subtopics among us. Hannah and Iain planned to meet separately so
    she could learn some of his research strategies. We planned to return next
    week with summaries of what we've found to make it easier for the group to
    get moving quickly. </p>

    <p> With John and Iain's work as a model, I spent about three and a half
    hours over this week working on my task for the group &mdash; I don't want
    to feel stupid again at the next meeting. </p>

    <p> We began sorting through the materials at this week's meeting. Iain and
    Hannah were able to collect some quality materials, and the summaries
    they've written help me understand their value quickly. They've clearly put
    a lot of effort into the task. John's materials, on the other hand, were
    difficult to understand and required his help in interpreting what he
    meant. He seemed embarrassed and told us he'd rewrite the summaries to make
    them clearer. My summaries got some laughs, but the group seemed to be
    confused by them. Their questions make it clear that they didn't see the
    same value in them that I did &mdash; and their questions also made me see
    why. They were being polite, but I could still tell. Finally, Iain asked a
    few direct questions that helped me to understand everything a bit
    differently &mdash; he's really got good control on this whole project.
    Everyone agreed that there is plenty of time, and that we can wait until
    next week's meeting to review the new and updated materials from John and
    me. </p>

    <p> I spent another two hours getting new materials and rewriting my
    summaries. Hopefully this was time well spent. </p>

    <p> Iain was late to the meeting by about ten minutes, but Hannah was not
    in class at all, and didn't show up for the meeting, either. No one had
    heard anything from her, and no one could reach her. </p>

    <p> We began the meeting by working through our updated materials, and Iain
    and John were still concerned. After a few more questions that were
    reminiscent of last week, Iain pushed to move on. I'd only got through
    about half of my materials, but they didn't seem all that pleased. I felt
    stupid because I guess I still don't get it, so I was happy to move on.
    John's materials, on the other hand, were really solid, and he volunteered
    to put together what we've already got so we can turn it in next week. Iain
    pointed out that we really needed to get a draft going. John echoed this
    and I agreed, so it was settled. We split up the tasks of synthesizing the
    sections before we ended the meeting to keep us moving forward.  </p>

    <p> I spent an entire evening drafting my portion of the paper, and then I
    spent most of another day reworking it. </p>

    <p> John turned in our assignment during class, and our instructor gave us
    some of time in class to meet. We discussed our progress, but none of us
    expected to have this time, so no one brought their materials to review. I
    had already finished with my part, and I thought it was OK. Either everyone
    else was in the same position or they hadn't looked at it. We all left
    early. </p>

    <p> Hannah was back this week and wearing a cast. She slipped on some ice
    the weekend before and it landed her in the hospital for a week. She did
    bring a first draft of the section that was assigned to her in her absence
    &mdash; John emailed meeting notes to the whole group. </p>

    <p> Iain seemed like he didn't care this week, and he was a bit
    condescending to me, too. He brought a draft of his portion, but it doesn't
    look like he put much thought into it. There are a number of spots that
    read "to be determined," and I didn't see any citations or references. I
    was nervous when the group reviewed my work, but this time they actually
    seem satisfied with it &mdash; more than that, they seem impressed. I could
    read it on both John and Hannah's faces, and that was a relief. Iain seemed
    not to have paid much attention at all, so I got little reaction there. It
    wasn't perfect, but mostly now it was grammar or spelling, so it wasn't a
    big deal to me &mdash; it didn't leave me feeling stupid and confused.
    Hannah explained that her work was incomplete, and it clearly was, but
    (given the circumstances) even this much was great to have. John's writing
    was excellent. His piece was easy to read and made sense and he covered all
    the points he was supposed to &mdash; he must be putting a lot of time into
    this class. Throughout the meeting, Iain was really quiet. </p>

    <p> When we were done, I suggested that everyone trade their portion to
    another group member for a review. John volunteered to take Iain's and Iain
    claimed John's &mdash; probably because it was already in such good shape.
    However, Hannah said she wanted to take more time to finish her section. I
    didn't feel it was fair for Iain to take the easy task, so I reminded the
    group of Iain's early, insightful comments and asked that he look at my
    work; I took John's, instead. </p>

    <p> John's portion was in great shape, and it didn't take me more than an
    hour to read through it and fix the few mistakes that were there. Then I
    got an idea for presenting the information in a different way that could
    shed additional light on the topic. I spent an hour putting it together,
    but when I looked at the clock and saw how late it was, I switched to my
    other classwork, because I still have time to finish this later. </p>

    <p> Iain was in class this week, but he emailed the group about an hour and
    a half before the meeting to say that there was a family emergency and that
    he would not be able to make the meeting. He included his work on my
    section &mdash; and it didn't look he'd gone any deeper than the few
    changes we discussed in class last week. </p>

    <p> The meeting was pretty good, and I can see that the paper is definitely
    starting to take shape. Unfortunately, I noticed when I got to the meeting
    that I accidentally forgot to get back to my revisions of John's work.
    That's probably a good thing, because John and Hannah don't seem to
    understand what I was doing, anyway. Maybe it was too much of a stretch. I
    hope they don't think I don't understand what's going on. The three of
    wound up spending awhile discussing how happy we were for choosing this
    topic &mdash; it's more interesting than any of us expected. Feeling like
    much of the paper was in good shape, Hannah took the pieces home to
    assemble them into a full draft to use moving forward. </p>

    <p> Before the meeting ended, John asked about switching next week's
    meeting time so he could meet with another study group. With mid-terms
    coming, everyone agreed that we need extra time to prepare. However, we
    couldn't agree on a new time, so we decided instead to meet only for 30
    minutes. I sent an email to let Iain know of the change. </p>

    <p> This week turned out to be very busy, so I was thankful the group cut
    the meeting time down for this week. Hannah gave everyone a copy of the
    document she assembled. After about 15 minutes of what was scheduled to be
    a 30-minute meeting, Iain had not arrived. We went ahead without him and
    walked through what Hannah had put together. </p>

    <p> Hannah clearly spent a lot of time putting everything together. The
    formatting was consistent, and I didn't see anything missing. There was one
    empty section that she added, because she felt it was necessary after
    having read the whole piece. John joked that Iain should write it, and I
    told him that would mean he'd end up writing it anyway. We both laughed,
    but Hannah got upset and said we were being unfair. She pointed out that
    Iain had helped her in the beginning. I don't really believe he had an
    emergency last week, but we both stopped talking about it, and turned back
    to reviewing the document. </p>

    <p> Once we finished going through the document, we agreed to make
    notes/corrections/suggestions for next week. As we were getting ready to
    leave, Iain walked in. Hannah quickly asked him if he was OK and what was
    going on. He said his brother needed him. We made sure he had a copy and
    told him what we'd all be doing for next week. </p>

    <p> I spent about two hours reviewing the document, because I wanted to
    make sure I was doing my part &mdash; I didn't want to be seen as another
    Iain. However, I had a lot of studying to do for mid-terms and there are
    still many weeks left in the project, so I figured that was enough. </p>

    <p> Surprisingly, Iain was already there when I arrived. Everyone was
    impressed by my attention to detail &mdash; it seems I found more errors
    than anyone else. Hannah volunteered to take everyone else's copies and
    make all the changes for the draft that we are supposed to turn in next
    week in class. John pointed out the section that was still missing or
    incomplete. Iain said that it was too late to get it into the draft. He
    figured it should be fine to include a note that it will be in the final
    version. Clearly he wasn't going to fix it. I was uncomfortable with that,
    so I said I'd draft the section and get it to Hannah by the middle of the
    week. Hannah said that she'd incorporate the new content if she got it in
    time. Iain did offer some good suggestions on how to approach the new
    content, but that was all. </p>

    <p> The next evening, I asked John for help getting the section done in
    time. I had less time than I'd thought because of a surprise assignment in
    one class and I already had to do major rework in another. Also, the
    sections were more complicated than they looked. He came over, and we were
    able to write a decent draft for me to give Hannah the next day &mdash;
    plenty of time. Working with John helped to ground me, I think. If it was
    just me doing this whole project, it would be much less conventional, I
    think, but, working in a group, I don't get to do that. John kept reminding
    me of this with his "let's just get it done" approach. </p>

    <p> Hannah turned in our draft, and now we get to wait for feedback. </p>

    <p> We do, however, already know of some work that needs done. Last week,
    John and I noticed some problems in the draft that will need correcting.
    Also, it seems Iain barely touched my work when I asked that he review it
    &mdash; and John pointed out a number of other areas that could be
    improved. Iain had to leave early for another meeting, but when I suggested
    using some diagrams to illustrate our points, he sat there for another five
    minutes of giving us nothing. We spent some time sketching ideas and then
    everyone was happy to let me clean them up &mdash; I'd just taken an
    illustration class. John offered to reread the entire document.  </p>

    <p> I spent an hour putting together the diagrams. I'm pretty proud of them
    &mdash; I got to use some of the skills I just learned, and I got to be
    creative and experiment for the first time on this project. </p>

    <p> John and I started looking at the images I put together over the past
    week while we waited for Hannah and Iain to arrive. He seemed to be
    indifferent toward them, but when Hannah arrived, she said that Iain let
    her know he won tickets to the game tonight and that he wouldn't be coming
    to our meeting &mdash; why should he start showing up now?  </p>

    <p> On a positive note, she said she really liked the images I'd put
    together. John said they reflect my "quirky personality," and Hannah
    pointed out that they also included the right details to get the point
    across. She called them "functional, eye-catching, and memorable." After
    that, although I could tell John was still uncomfortable with them, he'd
    accepted it. He still said he wanted Iain's opinion, but just asked me to
    make a few small changes. That takes some of the fun out of the images, but
    I'm OK with that, as long as John and Hannah are. </p>

    <p> John made a lot of changes to the document, and some of them were
    pretty extensive. However, he walked through them at a high level and
    everyone agreed, so we moved on to prepare for the presentation. For the
    next meeting, we each took a part and decided that we should put together
    notes or a script for what we would say so we could practice it next week.
    Hannah said she'd pass this on to Iain. </p>

    <p> I've never minded public speaking, and I drafted a version of my script
    in about 30 minutes one evening. I also put together a PowerPoint, based on
    an outline of what everyone would cover. </p>

    <p> In class, the instructor returned our draft and we met briefly to
    review it. Unfortunately, while we already knew there were lots of problems
    with that version, the instructor left only five comments in our paper. I
    guess they expected much of it to change since it was only a draft, after
    all. One said "this shows promise," two corrected grammar issues in
    sentences that were already gone, and one requested that page numbers be
    added. The only thing valuable for me was a request to clarify one of the
    sections I wrote. The instructor said it was a "novel approach" and that it
    should therefore be explained more clearly and thoroughly. It was nice to
    know I'd made an impression and that someone who counts got it! </p>

    <p> During the weekly group meeting, we were all on time. The discussion
    began with how little feedback we got and whether this means the paper was
    in great shape or that instructor simply didn't really read the whole
    thing. I'm pretty sure it's the latter. Either way, I had the feedback we'd
    been waiting for and it was time to move forward. </p>

    <p> I asked Iain to please review my section again and he responded that he
    already did that once. I told him it'd be nice if he would actually read it
    this time; maybe that wasn't the best approach, because it turned into a
    shouting match, but I'm upset that he didn't do his job in the first place,
    and I said that, too. I was trying to tell him that I really wanted his
    feedback, but he got upset and snapped back that it was difficult to read
    my work because it was so bad. I was too embarrassed to respond, but
    thankfully John jumped in and defended me (sort of), pointing out that at
    least I showed up and tried hard. Hannah raised her voice and everyone
    quieted down. She focused us back on the presentation coming in two weeks
    and the fact that we hadn't practiced for it yet. Iain reluctantly agreed
    to take a look at my section again for next week but made sure to tell us
    he was too busy to go through the whole thing. </p>

    <p> The rest of the meeting was spent working through the presentation. The
    group used the PowerPoint I put together in a practice run. We made a few
    changes as we went, but I'd made a pretty good start. Iain really seems to
    have put a lot of time into his part and he sounded very polished. He also
    had lots of suggestions for the rest of us, but they were a bit hard to
    hear after the argument we just had. The presentation was running too long
    &mdash; particularly John's part. He doesn't seem very experienced at this
    sort of thing and said way too much, way too fast.  </p>

    <p> I spent about an hour revising my portion of the presentation and
    revising the slides during the week. </p>

    <p> Everyone arrived on time for the meeting this week. Iain provided
    feedback on my section and, in reading through it, it was clear that making
    these changes would require larger changes throughout the paper. We could
    easily just ignore them because what we had was not wrong, but making the
    changes was the better way to go. It's just frustrating because he could
    have caught this much earlier if he'd bothered to read the paper, but now
    it's so close to the end of class.  </p>

    <p> Hannah said she thought she could make the changes this week and
    volunteered to try if someone else would promise to read through it next
    week. After a pause, John volunteered. I can't believe that Iain didn't
    make the changes when he saw that they were needed and then that he
    wouldn't bother to even read it. It's his fault we're in this mess. </p>

    <p> This week the presentation was much better. After three practice runs,
    it sounded smooth. It's still running too long, but we agreed that everyone
    will probably speak faster in class and the instructor probably wouldn't be
    a stickler on time. </p>

    <p> This week I focused on my other classes and end-of-semester activities.
    </p>

    <p> The presentation went very smoothly. Hannah got nervous, spoke too
    quickly and faced the PowerPoint instead of the class, but she knew what
    she was talking about and it showed. The audience asked some good
    questions, which showed that they understood the presentation. Iain kept
    stepping forward to answer most of the questions without giving anyone else
    a chance &mdash; like he was trying to make it look like he'd done much
    more than he actually did. I think he even talked over John once. We should
    have discussed attire beforehand, because everyone but John dressed up. He
    looked out of place in his usual jeans and a sweater. I felt badly for him.
    </p>

    <p> At our meeting, Iain commented on John's casual clothes. John
    apologized for it, but it felt cruel because he knew his part and was well
    prepared. He already seemed embarrassed about his choice of clothes. Aside
    from that, we felt good about the work we'd done and we expect positive
    feedback and good grades. Hannah shared her updated version of the paper
    and, after a quick review of the changes, we ended early with John taking
    the paper to review it as we discussed last week.  </p>

    <p> As we were leaving, I asked John to send me a copy as soon as he's
    finished so I could take one last crack at it before we turned it in. When
    he did, I spent about an hour and a half reading through the new version,
    but I didn't make any more changes. </p>

    <p> At the final meeting, we reviewed the paper to make sure it was ready
    for submission at the end of the week. Iain volunteered to do a final read,
    print it and send it to the instructor. When I asked why he should bother
    now since he'd barely contributed anything to it during the semester, both
    John and Hannah stopped me- I guess they just wanted the project to be
    over. John suggested that I send it to him and submit the latest version at
    the deadline &mdash; if Iain could get his updates to me by that time,
    they'll go in, but otherwise we should go with what I've got. Iain was
    clearly annoyed, but he agreed. </p>

    <p> Iain got the document to me in plenty of time to send it in and there
    were very few changes. After I submitted it, I sent a copy of the finished
    product to the entire team. </p>
