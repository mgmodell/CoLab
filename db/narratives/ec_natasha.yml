    <p> In group time, we began by setting up weekly team meetings. My group
    members seem to be nice and one of them, Lionel, is a transfer student. The
    project is pretty big and fairly open-ended, so we brainstormed topic ideas
    for the most of the time. </p>

    <p> I tried to think creatively while we brainstormed. Most of what I
    suggested wasn't realistic and I knew that, but I was taught that you
    should throw out all ideas uncritically during a brainstorming session.
    They did make the rest of the group laugh, though, and others often built
    off of them, so I think it was a success. At some point, Lionel noticed
    that no one was taking notes, so we recounted what we could remember while
    he wrote them down, and we discussed those. </p>

    <p> Before the meeting ended, we crossed off the ones that didn't seem to
    work (this got rid of most of mine &mdash; haha!) and narrowed the list
    down to six. Alex asked us to each look for resources on all the topics so
    that next week, we will report back and select a topic together. </p>

    <p> This was not exactly a difficult task and it only took about an hour of
    my time. </p>

    <p> Anika found a lot of materials for one of the topics that I had a rough
    time with. Alex and Lionel also focused on the same two as I did. We ended
    up with a lot of duplication, but at least we all know those topics. When
    we dug into what Anika found for the third topic, we couldn't see how we
    would be able to use much of it &mdash; the research just had mentions of
    what we needed. Our discussion quickly centered on our most promising two
    topics. </p>

    <p> There was a lot of discussion about which to choose &mdash; everyone
    seemed to have a strong opinion. I suggested that maybe we could combine
    them into one. That didn't really work, but I think it helped us to see
    them a bit differently before we settled into making decisions. Our first
    vote was split down the middle, so Alex made a list of pros and cons. That
    helped us to put things in perspective. Our next vote was unanimous. As
    Alex pointed out, the other topic, although more exciting on the surface,
    would have probably been much more complicated and difficult. </p>

    <p> The obvious next step was to find more materials on our selected topic,
    so we figured out the major subtopics and divided them amongst ourselves.
    We decided everyone would return next week with summaries of what we've
    found to make it easier for the group to get moving quickly. To make sure
    we didn't wind up with a million competing summaries for the many duplicate
    materials, Alex thought to split up the materials we'd already got among
    us. </p>

    <p> I found some more materials this week, then I wrote my summaries. I
    probably spent an hour on this. </p>

    <p> During our meeting, we began sorting through the materials. Lionel's
    and my materials were in good shape. I thought that one of Lionel's
    summaries was a bit odd, but when I read it out loud to check if I was
    crazy, I realized I was reading it wrong. I got everyone to laugh again
    &mdash; but this time it wasn't at all intentional. Lionel took it a bit
    further, however, and turned it into an interesting suggestion.  </p>

    <p> Alex's summaries, unfortunately, were confusing, and no one understood
    them. He had to explain what he meant a lot of the time; that was
    frustrating. He seemed a bit embarrassed and told us he'd rewrite the
    summaries to make them clearer.  </p>

    <p> Anika's summaries, on the other hand, were just a sentence or two each.
    Initially, she seemed to think that would be useful to us, and she couldn't
    seem to understand why they weren't. After some awkward moments, Alex asked
    her if she'd prefer to use my summaries or her own to write the paper; I
    think it clicked for her. We all had things to do to improve our work for
    next week. </p>

    <p> It took me about twenty minutes to apply my group's suggestions. </p>

    <p> Anika wasn't at the meeting this week. She wasn't in class, either, and
    no one had heard anything from her. We weren't sure what was going on.
    </p>

    <p> When it was clear that she wouldn't be coming, we began working through
    Alex's updated materials; they were much improved. They could use some
    editing, but at least they make sense now, and he is obviously very smart.
    I think maybe his mind races ahead of his fingers. Lionel volunteered to
    try to redo Anika's work and put what we have together for the assignment
    due next week, but I said no. I don't think it's fair that he should be
    overloaded like that. I told him I'd work on Anika's part and get it to
    Lionel three days before class so he could include them. I also asked Alex
    to put together a basic outline of what the paper should look like so we
    can get started on that. </p>

    <p> It took me about an hour to redo Anika's materials and their summaries
    and I got Lionel the materials a day early. The next day we heard from
    Anika; her mother had been ill and Anika went home to visit her in the
    hospital. In spite of this, she still managed to send us her redone
    summaries. I expect Lionel had time to incorporate them. </p>

    <p> Lionel turned in our assignment this week in class. Our instructor gave
    us some time to meet as a group at the end of class. We reviewed the
    outline Alex put together since no one else had brought anything with them.
    Alex seemed to be satisfied with it, but Anika and I weren't. We didn't
    really have much time to get into it, though. </p>

    <p> At our meeting, it took a while to really understand where we weren't
    connecting. I thought that Anika and I both wanted the same thing, but it
    turned out we had completely ideas of where this was going! Alex, Anika and
    I talked for about half an hour, but Lionel mostly didn't say anything. I
    don't know if he just didn't care, but he was pretty quiet. Ultimately, we
    sort of settled on my plan and modified the outline Alex had put together
    to look more like what I was describing. </p>

    <p> Anika then suggested we split the outline up into quarters and each
    write one for next week. Lionel spoke up quickly for the second section, so
    I grabbed the first part. Anika took the last, and that left the third part
    for Alex. </p>

    <p> I banged my head against this assignment for over an hour before I gave
    up. This approach just wasn't working and I wasn't sure how we could fix
    it. </p>

    <p> No one was really able to make their pieces work quite right, so we had
    to rethink our approach. Anika once again brought out her initial
    preference from last time, but Alex was a step ahead of her and pointed out
    where we'd run into the same problems that way. Lionel listened for a bit
    and then suggested that we try something he had used on a past project, and
    it was a really exciting idea. It would, of course, require some
    adaptation, but it could work out very well for us.  </p>

    <p> Anika and I ironed it out together. In spite of it being his idea,
    Lionel seemed to be nervous about suggesting anything, but he did
    contribute. About halfway into our meeting, we started looking back at the
    pieces we'd already written to see if/where they still fit. It looked like
    we would be left with about half a paper still to write. </p>

    <p> This time, we each claimed pieces that were left to write. Anika took
    one of the bits that I'd already started looking at. I told her I wanted to
    write that one, but she wouldn't budge. She eventually traded with me for
    another piece, but not the one I'd really wanted. I just went with it
    because I didn't want to argue. </p>

    <p> I had a lot of writing to do this week, but I also had a lot to do in
    my other classes, so I spread this out over two nights of about an hour and
    a half each. Maybe not the most productive time in the world, but I got it
    done. </p>

    <p> I was a bit late because it took me longer than I'd expected to finish
    up a project due in the class immediately after our meeting. As it turned
    out, though, I wasn't the only one late &mdash; Alex didn't show up for
    about half an hour! I guess mid-term study sessions are taking up a lot of
    time. </p>

    <p> Everyone was happy with what we had this week. After running through
    what we had, the paper was starting to look pretty good. We spent much of
    our time assembling the pieces into a single paper. When we did, we
    realized that neither the introduction nor the conclusion worked very well
    any longer. I figured that Lionel should write these, since he had to have
    the best handle on it. But he responded that it wasn't his idea and that he
    wasn't comfortable with it. This seemed absurd; I reminded him that he was
    the one who suggested this structure when we were all stuck. Eventually, he
    said he'd do it but he wanted someone to review it afterward; Anika
    volunteered.  </p>

    <p> Alex volunteered to rewrite the conclusion, but I was afraid his
    writing wasn't very good, so I asked him instead to proofread and format
    the document while I rewrote the conclusion. Anika didn't have anything for
    the week and I think she didn't want to feel like a slacker, so she said
    she'd proofread the document, as well &mdash; just to have an extra set of
    eyes on it. Before we ended the meeting, I told everyone I'd be late next
    week because one of my midterms would run until the start of this meeting.
    </p>

    <p> The conclusion was pretty straightforward, but I stupidly started off
    trying to fix what we had; that just made a mess. When I decided to just go
    ahead and rewrite the whole thing, everything fell into place nicely. I was
    able to knock it out in under an hour. </p>

    <p> I arrived just as the group finished going through the fixes to the
    paper. I figured I'd go through it on my own later, but everyone looked
    satisfied. </p>

    <p> We next looked at Lionel's introduction, and Anika immediately asked
    what everyone was thinking: why was it so short? Lionel just shrugged and
    we all read it. As it turned out, Anika shouldn't have said anything before
    she read it &mdash; it really covered everything it needed to and was
    pretty good. Neither Alex nor I had any ideas for improving it.  </p>

    <p> I think Anika felt like she had to do something. After she thought
    about it for a moment, she said that while nothing was missing, she had
    some ideas for beefing it up a bit. A few minutes later, we had a new
    version that was longer and felt a bit meatier. </p>

    <p> When we were done, Anika said she'd add in the conclusion, make the
    changes we talked about and have a version of the paper ready to turn in
    next week in class. I, in turn, volunteered to try to make the larger
    changes that Alex suggested. Lionel said he'd start working on a PowerPoint
    for the upcoming presentation. Alex asked if anyone minded if he didn't do
    anything this week because he has a late midterm next week in his toughest
    subject. It made sense to me and no one seemed to mind, so we went with it.
    </p>

    <p> I did re-read the document this week, and Alex and Anika had done a
    great job with it. It took me about two hours to make the changes, though,
    because I had to do a bunch of research to support it. I was still left
    with a bunch of questions that I really need the group to work out. </p>

    <p> Anika not only brought a copy of our paper to class for the instructor,
    but also brought copies for each of us to look at between class and our
    meeting. This way we didn't have to waste our meeting time on reading
    through it. As a result, I was able to merge my changes into the version
    Anika gave to the instructor, so everything was nicely consolidated. </p>

    <p> I brought the merged document, along with a list of remaining questions
    and possible answers, to our group meeting. We spent twenty minutes on that
    before we came to any answers. Alex was pretty quiet during most of the
    discussion, but after noticing something, he said he thought he had an
    idea. He tried to explain it and, in true Alex form, he didn't do a very
    good job, but what I did understand seemed to make sense. I think he saw
    that we weren't quite following his explanation, so he asked if he could
    take it home and work on it for next week. I was hesitant, because he
    doesn't usually explain his own ideas well, but I said OK. We still have
    time in case it requires too much cleanup. In fact, everyone was OK with
    it. </p>

    <p> We next discussed the presentation &mdash; beginning with the
    PowerPoint Lionel had put together. Before Anika could comment (because she
    always does), Lionel pointed out that this was just a start; he knew there
    wasn't much to it. He recommended that everyone claim a few slides and
    modify them when they worked on what they were going to say. At this, Anika
    just shut her mouth. I have to admit, that was pretty satisfying. She's not
    mean or anything, but it was nice not to hear her being critical for once.
    </p>

    <p> I claimed a few slides, including the first one, but Lionel said he
    wanted to introduce us. I was surprised, because I didn't figure he'd
    volunteer for such a visible role. We ultimately decided that we should
    both give it a shot and see which one we all like best when we practice
    next week. I'm actually excited about making it into a bit of a
    competition. </p>

    <p> While I'm told I'm good at it, I really hate public speaking. I wanted
    to go first because I want to get my part over with as soon as possible. I
    think I over-prepare to avoid looking stupid. I spent about two hours
    agonizing over this two-minute presentation. </p>

    <p> Everyone's presentations were pretty good, except for Lionel's. I'm not
    sure what was going on, but it didn't seem like he had prepared very much.
    He did some fun things with his slides, but then he just read them
    verbatim. Also, I thought the slides were also quite tacky. I tried to keep
    out of it because I didn't want to be obnoxious, since his work was being
    compared to mine. Anika was pretty harsh, though. I don't think she knows
    how not to be, but she really should have been gentler; he's really bright,
    but he doesn't seem to know it. I think he takes criticism pretty hard.
    </p>

    <p> It wasn't really much of a competition. I'll be doing the introduction
    &mdash; even Lionel voted for me to do it. I am going to try to use some of
    his ideas to spruce up the slides though &mdash; just not quite so much. I
    especially like what he did with images of our heads bouncing onto the
    slide. It was a bit silly, but fun. </p>

    <p> I spent another hour this week on my slides and practicing. I also
    enlisted my best friend to listen and give me feedback. </p>

    <p> In class, the instructor returned the drafts. We met briefly to review
    ours. There weren't many comments, and most of them were pretty minor or
    issues that I had already fixed. There was one comment, however, that
    concerned us all: a diagram might help here. We were presenting our
    instructor with a great big wall of text! How did we miss that? We'd
    definitely have things to talk about at this week's meeting. </p>

    <p> Lionel arrived late as we were talking about our complete lack of
    images. While we were still at the complaining-about-it stage, though, he
    was way ahead of us. He actually apologized as he pulled out a bunch of
    sketches he'd "thrown together." They were a great start. They were tough
    to see, so I quickly copied them over with black pen on full sheets so they
    were crisper. We worked on them for half an hour, making small changes here
    and there. I volunteered create new versions to include in the document.
    </p>

    <p> We spent the rest of the meeting working through the presentation.
    Everyone sounded better this week &mdash; especially Lionel. It was like he
    was a completely different person. We all commented on the dramatic
    improvement. I'm not sure he quite believed it, but there was some relief
    on his face and I felt better. He was also more active in providing
    feedback to everyone else. He pointed out that Alex had included something
    that wasn't actually in our paper. Alex told him where he'd found it and
    Lionel seemed glad, but not satisfied. He asked if we wanted to talk in the
    presentation about something that we didn't mention in the paper. I don't
    think it was a big deal because it was true, but he clearly felt like it
    was a bad idea and he wouldn't let it go. He wasn't telling Alex to take it
    out &mdash; he was asking where we should add it to the paper. He offered
    to make the change, so we said OK. </p>

    <p> I practiced some more for the presentation, but mostly I already felt
    good about that. I instead spent my time on creating new versions of the
    images for the paper. Lionel must have spent a lot of time thinking about
    these. I was able to make them clearer and crisper, but there wasn't much
    else I could do to improve upon them, and they really add a lot to the
    paper. </p>

    <p> Everyone loved what the images did for our paper &mdash; they would
    make it a lot easier for people to understand certain parts of it. Lionel
    also claimed one of the images for one of his slides, and it worked much
    better than the bullet points he'd had on there. I still can't believe we
    didn't have any images in at all until now. </p>

    <p> The presentation was much better this week. After another three
    practice runs, it sounded smooth. I felt bad for Lionel, though, because
    after last week's discussion, Alex had second thoughts and removed the
    controversial bit from his presentation, but didn't think to let Lionel
    know, so Lionel still added it to the paper. I decided to keep Lionel's
    photos of us on our introduction slide, and everyone liked that. Finally,
    and arguably most importantly, we managed to cut it down to the correct
    time. </p>

    <p> I practiced a few more times during the week when I was able to find a
    moment here and there. </p>

    <p> The presentation went OK, but not quite as smoothly as I'd hoped. Alex
    seemed nervous and got quieter than I'd have liked, but I'm pretty sure
    that most people heard him. Anika, on the other hand, raced through her
    presentation; I don't think anyone understood her. We wound up finishing up
    about 30 seconds early. </p>

    <p> Our classmates asked some good questions, which showed that our
    presentation was decent; they understood enough to ask questions. Anika,
    who spoke last, naturally received all the questions, but she handed them
    off to whomever she felt was best suited to answer them &mdash; that was a
    nice touch. There weren't a lot of questions, and none of them came to me.
    </p>

    <p> We should have discussed clothes beforehand; Lionel wore slacks and a
    sports jacket, and I wore a dress skirt and blouse. Anika and Alex were
    dressed very casually, and it was a bit uncomfortable. </p>

    <p> Generally, though, I think we felt good about the work we'd done. I
    expect positive feedback and good grades. </p>

    <p> We only met briefly this week because we were mostly finished and we
    all had finals to study for, but Alex said he had time to go through the
    paper once more. Quite frankly, he's the best person to do it, so no one
    disagreed. We also agreed that we'd only meet briefly next week to make
    sure Alex didn't find any huge problems. </p>

    <p> At the final meeting, we reviewed the paper to make sure it was ready
    for submission at the end of the week. As we went through it, Anika took
    issue with a few of the changes Alex made. It didn't seem like anything
    until she pointed it out, but some of the language he used was a bit
    ambiguous. It could be read to mean the opposite of what we intended.  </p>

    <p> It took us all a while to see it, because we all know what we're trying
    to say, but once I saw it, I couldn't un-see it. Alex seemed to have the
    hardest time of it. He hesitantly volunteered to fix it before submission,
    but we could all see that was a bad idea. Anika said she had no problem
    doing it as long as everyone trusted her, because there wasn't enough time
    for her to make the changes and get us all to say OK in time. Of course, we
    all trusted her and said so. </p>

    <p> The night before she sent it in to our instructor, Anika sent us a copy
    of the document just to make sure we were all OK with it. I didn't have a
    chance to read it carefully, but I wrote back and said OK. </p>
