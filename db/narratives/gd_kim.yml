    <p> In group time the first week, we began by setting up weekly team
    meetings. Anna's a sophomore and I think her experience is valuable, but
    she's also very pushy. Jose seems like he'll work hard, but I especially
    like Sam. The way he speaks is a bit strange because he uses a lot of big
    words. It doesn't seem like he's showing off or anything, he just thinks a
    lot about the words he uses. The trouble is that he often doesn't seem to
    use them quite right. </p>

    <p> The project is fairly open-ended, so we brainstormed topic ideas for
    the rest of the time. We all volunteered a few topics, but I didn't have
    any ideas, so I kept my mouth shut. I'm pretty sure that one of Sam's
    suggestions was a joke and one of them I couldn't understand at all, but
    one of them was a really good idea. No one seemed to understand any of
    them, and I didn't want to say anything. Later, I was surprised when Anna
    suggested the same thing as though it was brand new. I don't think she was
    trying to steal credit or anything, I just think she didn't understand him.
    Anyway, it's a good idea. </p>

    <p> Before the meeting ended, we narrowed it down to five ideas. Anna told
    us we should each look for resources on one topic and then report back next
    week. She spoke up for a topic she'd already worked on in another class and
    Sam quickly spoke up for another. Jose eventually took another one and I
    said I'd take the two that were left. Anna didn't like that and said she'd
    take one of them, but I put my foot down &mdash; she's not going to walk
    all over me. Ultimately, we compromised and split it. </p>

    <p> I spent about an hour researching my topic this week and I think we're
    off to a good start, so I feel pretty good. </p>

    <p> We began the meeting by going over the materials we'd collected over
    the last week. Anna was clearly disappointed, and she didn't hide it well.
    She spent most of the meeting talking about how she did her research and
    it's a big help, but makes me feel like I'm a child. I'm going to have to
    do a lot of it again. Sam asked some questions indicating that he didn't
    see why his materials are mostly unusable, and Anna just laughed at him.
    He's braver than I am, though, because he asked again. Anna responded with
    a few detailed questions that Sam couldn't answer. She then went to her own
    notes to answer the same questions. It seemed cruel, and I'm glad it wasn't
    me because I couldn't have answered those same questions. Sure, they are
    important, but we're new to this and she's already worked on this topic
    before. </p>

    <p> Jose suggested that, in the interest of time, maybe we just go with the
    topic she worked on, but Anna insisted that we had to redo our work. She
    pointed out that we all need to be able to do the research She was right
    &mdash; even if it's a pain in the neck. I just wish she was nicer about
    it. Sam and Jose also agreed with it. </p>

    <p> After the meeting, I pulled Anna aside and told her that she was out of
    line in being so rude to Sam. It was uncalled for and I just couldn't stand
    by and let her do it. She pled innocent, though. She said that she honestly
    thought he was joking the first time, and she didn't mean to insult him.
    She said it wasn't intentional, but that she'll try to be more sensitive in
    the future. </p>

    <p> The next night, I spent another hour finding and skimming through new
    materials. I was actually still able to use most of my original materials.
    I found a bunch of additional ones, too. I don't love this topic, though,
    so it feels like a waste of time. </p>

    <p> During our meeting, we sorted through the materials we had to decide on
    a topic. There was some conflict between Sam and Anna &mdash; Sam pushed
    for the topic he'd researched, while Anna made up her mind that we'd go
    with hers. I didn't want to get involved, but as Sam explained it, it did
    sound like more fun. It had a lot of potential to let us touch on lots of
    different areas &mdash; but that's exactly why Anna didn't like it &mdash;
    she thought we wouldn't be able to focus ourselves. Jose is supporting Anna
    &mdash; I think he's scared of her. We went back and forth for most of the
    meeting and it was a pretty good discussion, but in the end, we went with
    Anna's topic. It's a pretty good one, and it's also clear that she will not
    give up. </p>

    <p> After the topic was settled, there wasn't much time left, but Anna
    jumped right into drafting an outline and she wouldn't let anyone else
    help. Sam suggested something to make the paper easier to read, but Anna
    didn't like it and wanted to go with a more conventional approach. She
    figured that we just didn't know how to write a paper, so she spent about
    ten minutes explaining to us what an outline is and why we use it. No one
    made any comments on the outline after that. </p>

    <p> Jose suggested that we each take a few of our sources, search for more
    on our own and then write up summaries for next week, so we're ready for
    the first assignment. Anna agreed and started assigning them out. However,
    she acted like she was the only one with a brain and didn't trust any of
    the rest of us to get anything right She took all the materials that were
    actually interesting and offered any depth &mdash; strange since she made
    such a big deal out of making sure we were all "learning" during the
    initial research. This was not OK, so I told her which topics I'd take. Sam
    and Jose backed me up by making their own preferences known.  </p>

    <p> We spent time negotiating who took what, but it was much better than
    her assignments. This clearly irritated Anna, but with everyone
    disagreeing, there wasn't much she could do. She couldn't let go entirely,
    though, and when Jose claimed one that she wanted, she told him she'd
    "help" him with it because it was very complex &mdash; does she not see how
    insulting that is? </p>

    <p> I spent about an hour and a half on reading, searching and getting
    writing my summaries this week. </p>

    <p> Jose and Sam were a bit late to the meeting. Anna was visibly upset,
    but she didn't say anything about it. Sam explained that he forgot to
    finish two of the five parts he was working on, and I thought she was going
    to explode. I don't see why this was such a big deal since we've still got
    time before even the first assignment. After we took a look at everyone's
    work, she couldn't contain herself any longer and asked why no one had done
    their work. She compared what we brought to what she brought. She's got
    what looks like completed portions to be added directly into the paper.
    </p>

    <p> I told her to give it a rest &mdash; we still have time and no one was
    slacking off, but she got upset and asked how I would be able to put
    anything together using materials as thin as this. That's when Sam spoke
    up. He made a joke about how poorly he'd done with his part &mdash; his
    wasn't just thin, it was nonexistent. It wasn't actually funny, but
    everyone laughed, and he volunteered to assemble next week's assignment
    since he still has pieces to do. He also suggested that we take a look at
    what we've got and whether the outline we put together still fits. It was
    really either that or fight for an hour, so everyone is all for it. </p>

    <p> I had some new ideas about how to sequence the paper Anna particularly
    liked one idea, but Sam pointed out that he wouldn't have time to do it
    all, and she started getting upset again. I offered to make the changes if
    Sam could get the rest of it done by the middle of the week. Sam gladly
    accepted this and we decided to coordinate later.  </p>

    <p> Naturally, before we left, Anna had to remind everyone that we need to
    keep working on our summaries because we've got the draft due in another
    four weeks. </p>

    <p> After the meeting, I asked Sam to let me know when he was done with his
    part. When he was done, I suggested that we meet at the library the next
    evening. We got to talking about the project and I pointed out that I knew
    our topic was his idea first. I think he really appreciated that. We worked
    together on the revisions and it went smoothly, with me doing most of the
    writing. There was only one time we disagreed and that was just because I
    didn't think we could make Anna go along with Sam's idea. It's just not
    worth fighting with her. We finished the writing quicker than I expected
    &mdash; maybe an hour or so.  </p>

    <p> The day after I met with Sam, I cleaned everything up and put it all
    together for submission. All told, I think I spent about two hours on this
    outside of our weekly meeting. </p>

    <p> I turned in our assignment in class and the instructor allowed us some
    group time at the end of class, so we all reviewed what Sam and I put
    together. Anna was particularly pleased with what we'd done, so the meeting
    went well. </p>

    <p> Sam and I arrived a couple of minutes early for our meeting and we were
    joking a bit, but then Anna showed up and we got down to business. Sam was
    really getting excited about the paper, and he suggested that we further
    build out our summaries into the paper. Anna looked at him like he was dumb
    and told him (like it was obvious) that each of the summaries would fit in
    multiple places in our outline. He looked confused &mdash; like he wasn't
    quite sure what he was trying to say, but that's when Jose showed up and
    joked that maybe we should take the week off! He argued that we had to wait
    for the instructor's feedback, anyway. I thought it was funny, so I
    encouraged him, but then I realized he didn't think it was a joke. Of
    course we would have to keep working if we wanted to get everything done in
    time.  </p>

    <p> Anna took both of us seriously and got upset. She spent the next ten
    minutes explaining that the instructor probably would barely look at our
    papers, much less provide meaningful feedback. She pointed out that it'd
    probably be weeks before we got anything back at all and by that point we'd
    have no time left to get our draft together. She also made the point that
    if we kept going, we might be in a good place to break later during
    midterms. Jose was disappointed and said he'd be late next week either way
    because of practice. </p>

    <p> We split the paper into quarters, and we each took a section to write
    up for next week. </p>

    <p> My section was supported by some of my own summaries, as well as a lot
    of Anna's work and I have to admit that Anna's a good writer; she made it
    easy for me to put things together with her notes and pointers. It's like
    she's known exactly how this paper would look from the very beginning. </p>

    <p> Again, Sam and I arrived at around the same time for the meeting this
    week. Anna arrived a few minutes later, and we reviewed our work. We spent
    a long time talking about some of my observations and what they could mean
    in other parts of the paper. Anna was distracted from Sam's poor writing
    skills by his impressive artistry. This pushed us to spend some time
    looking through Anna's and my pieces to try to come up with good visuals
    there, too. I volunteered to add a chart of some of my data, but Anna said
    no, because she wanted Sam to do it. I haven't really done that kind of
    work, and I wanted to give it a shot, but Anna still wouldn't let me. She
    wants me to do the proofreading because she thinks I'm really good at it
    (even if it is boring), and she doesn't want me to be overworked. It's not
    worth fighting about it. There'll be other projects... </p>

    <p> When Jose arrived, he reminded us that his team is preparing for their
    upcoming game and he'll be late for the next couple of weeks. He was very
    upset when we looked at Anna's work because I guess she changed a lot of
    what he wrote. I didn't see what he gave her, so I'm not sure, but he said
    that he feels like Anna's ignoring or ripping out the work of everyone who
    doesn't do what she wants (true). He pointed out that she's always telling
    everyone what to do (he's right). Anna said she was just trying to make
    sure the paper feels unified in its vision.  </p>

    <p> They probably would have argued for the rest of the meeting, but I
    figure that since Anna's part of our team, we're going to have to work with
    her. She's got good ideas, so I pointed out that even though the paper is
    much different from what I'd thought it would be, it was turning out well.
    Jose asked us to at least consider including the perspective that Anna
    ripped out. Anna said no, because we would end up with just another boring
    paper that anyone could write; we'd have to spend a huge amount of time
    rewriting the paper that way. She asked if Jose wanted to do a complete
    rewrite for next week. At this, Jose gave up and we decided to keep the
    paper as she'd written it. We didn't look at Jose's work because he would
    have to make some major changes to it. </p>

    <p> I spent about half an hour cleaning up my part a little more, but that
    was about all for this week. </p>

    <p> Jose was late again when he arrived this week, but this time he was
    visibly limping. I'm not sure if Anna thought he was faking it, but she
    rudely told him to "please try to be on time in the future." Naturally,
    this set Jose off, and he shot back that it didn't matter since she was
    basically writing the whole thing herself. Seeing that this was going
    nowhere, I tried to calm everyone down. I reminded everyone that we're all
    equals working on this project together, and I even made Jose and Anna both
    say so out loud. Of course, that won't make any difference to Anna, but it
    made Jose feel better. </p>

    <p> After reviewing each other's work, we decided to swap papers to
    proofread them. I took Jose's, but I also wanted to get started on
    assembling the paper, so I also volunteered to do that. Anna said no at
    first, because she thought I couldn't handle matching up everyone's
    proofreads with the assembled paper, but I promised that I'd reassemble it
    next week if I couldn't match things up. I felt uncomfortable that we still
    hadn't seen all the pieces together. </p>

    <p> As we were getting ready to leave, Jose asked if anyone would mind
    changing our meeting time for next week &mdash; he had a study session to
    prepare for one of his midterms. I also have midterms to study for and Sam
    suggested that we cancel the meeting, since the paper is in pretty good
    shape. Naturally, Anna said no. She said we should still meet, but that we
    could do it briefly, immediately after class to share our changes. </p>

    <p> I proofread everyone's papers as I was putting them together into the
    final paper this week. It took me about two hours, and I had to move a
    bunch of things around, but it made me feel better to know that we were
    almost ready to turn this thing in. </p>

    <p> During this week's class some of the discussion touched on the topic of
    our paper; both Jose and Sam spoke up during the discussion. There was some
    good debate about the competing points of view. Sam's comments made sense
    to me because I know him at this point, but he doesn't explain himself
    well, and I'm not sure it made sense to anyone else. </p>

    <p> After class, we met briefly as we decided last week. Everyone was
    excited to see the full paper. Jose and Anna pointed out a problem with one
    of the images and asked Sam to fix it, but he said he couldn't. Anna was
    disappointed, but Sam said he'd already tried to fix it and it always came
    out worse instead of better. Finally he said he'd give it another try, and
    that was enough to let us move on. </p>

    <p> Sam asked about our in-class discussion and how we wanted to address
    that in the paper. It was clear that there were multiple points of view,
    and we should at least acknowledge them. Anna listened for a bit but soon
    got tired of it and told Jose that would make the paper boring. Compared
    with what we've got, she's kind of right.  </p>

    <p> Sam pointed out that we need to at least acknowledge the in-class
    conversation, and Jose jumped on this, volunteering to add a section about
    it. Anna agreed, but didn't want Jose to write it because I guess she
    doesn't trust him to make it look good enough to turn in next week. I said
    I'd review it when Jose got it to me and then integrate it. Anna was OK
    with that. I asked Jose to get it to me by mid-week. Anna caught me on the
    way out and told me to make sure to keep the new section brief. </p>

    <p> Jose got the new section to me late in the week, but there was still
    plenty of time for me to put everything together for class. I probably
    spent about an hour on it. </p>

    <p> In addition to the copy to be turned in, I brought copies of our draft
    for each of us to review. I couldn't stay after class to discuss it,
    though, and I guess no one met, anyway. This was going to be a busy week
    for me with an unexpected project dropped on me in another class.  </p>

    <p> Later in the week, Jose thanked me during the week for putting the
    paper together, and it really made my day. I told him that I'd be a little
    late to the meeting because of this other project I had to work on; he said
    he'd let the others know. When I arrived, I learned that Jose told Sam but
    "forgot" to tell Anna. She sat in the meeting alone with no idea what was
    going on. That was a pretty awful thing to do and, although she tried to
    hide it, Anna was definitely hurt. I felt terrible. </p>

    <p> Anna had a long list of changes to the paper and some of them were
    pretty big, but no one said anything &mdash; I know I felt guilty. I
    imagine everyone else was, too. She asked us to take another look at the
    whole paper, and read it straight through for next week to make sure we
    haven't missed anything. </p>

    <p> Our next task was to prepare for the presentation. Anna drafted a
    PowerPoint for us to use and then assigned slides to each of us. At one
    point, she asked if anyone was upset with their piece and no one was, so
    she kept going. Then she told us we needed to write up our talking points
    for each of our slides and to practice a few times for next week. </p>

    <p> I had a lot to cover in my portion, so it took me awhile to put
    together a set of notes. I spent a lot of time practicing it and reworking
    it to try to make sure it fit the time allowed and to make sure it felt
    like it flowed properly. I don't like public speaking, but if I'm prepared
    then I'll be OK. Two hours later, I felt OK. </p>

    <p> Wow! I don't know what Jose and Sam were thinking &mdash; it looks like
    they just threw together some notes and didn't bother trying with anything
    else. They spoke way too long and were off-topic throughout. Anna had
    obviously put more thought into it, and I could tell that she'd actually
    practiced, but she also needed a lot of work. I like Jose, but he seemed to
    be almost happy to be able to criticize her for a change, and that was
    disturbing. She didn't like that at all and asked if he was trying to make
    the presentation better or make her feel bad. He shut up after that.  </p>

    <p> After three practice runs together, everyone took home a list of things
    to fix their presentations. I need to look out at the audience and speak
    louder &mdash; that sounds easy, but it's just not. More practice for me.
    </p>

    <p> I spent about half an hour practicing this week and asked one of my
    friends to listen to it. She liked it and gave me a few recommendations,
    too, but mostly it was just good to practice in front of real people. </p>

    <p> In class, the instructor returned the drafts to the groups and we met
    briefly during class to review it. The instructor left only six comments in
    our paper, and most of them were pretty small, but one asked us to further
    develop a section. </p>

    <p> Our meeting started with another fight between Anna and Jose. Jose
    interpreted one of the comments to mean that he should write more in the
    section about alternative perspectives, and Anna, predictably, disagreed.
    Anna talked down to him a lot, and that just kept making him angrier, but
    it was clear that he wasn't getting anywhere. It would mean rewriting the
    whole paper and no one wanted that. Ultimately, Jose gave up and Anna said
    she'd make the changes the instructor requested this week. </p>

    <p> The presentations were better this week, but we still need more
    practice and a bunch of rework. Jose changed his part in response to what
    he thought the instructor was saying, but he said he'd change it to make
    sure it was still in line with what everyone else wrote. We do have the
    note in the paper, so I guess he's got that covered.  </p>

    <p> Anna had improved upon hers significantly since last week. I don't know
    how she did it, but it sounded perfect. Most importantly, this time Sam
    focused on our content rather than the diagrams. Finally, we talked about
    how we should dress for the presentation. I thought it would be a great
    idea to have costumes in keeping with our topic and both Jose and Sam liked
    that, but Anna said it would make us look like children. She said we had to
    wear business attire so we would look professional. When we ended the
    meeting, Anna reminded everyone that our presentation is in just two weeks.
    </p>

    <p> I had a few small changes to make and did a few practice runs this
    week, but probably not more than half an hour. </p>

    <p> I had to be late this week because of another meeting. When I arrived,
    Anna was finishing up looking at the changes. I asked that we take another
    look, but Anna told me that it would be better for me to look at it after
    the meeting, instead &mdash; for the sake of time. Although it didn't seem
    like anyone made very many changes, the presentation felt much better this
    week. Whatever it was, after two practice runs, we sounded smooth. It's
    still running too long, but the group agreed that everyone will probably
    speak faster in class, and the instructor probably won't be a stickler on
    time. </p>

    <p> When everything looked and sounded good, Anna actually suggested we end
    early this week, and everyone agreed. However, before we left, Anna
    reminded everyone to wear formal business clothes to the presentation next
    week. </p>

    <p> I practiced once this week with a friend, but mostly I focused on my
    other coursework. </p>

    <p> We were the only group dressed professionally, and I think that
    probably earned us some points. I think that all my practice paid off; the
    instructor only had to ask me to speak up once. Jose stumbled on his first
    few sentences, but then he relaxed and I think it came out well overall.
    The biggest surprise, though was Sam; he added an analogy at the end that
    not only tied everything together, but it also made everyone laugh. It was
    unexpected and risky, but it worked out well. There weren't a lot of
    questions for us and naturally, Anna stepped forward to answer them. </p>

    <p> I think we can expect positive feedback and good grades. </p>

    <p> Since the paper is mostly finished, we all decided to cancel this
    week's meeting and, instead, each give the paper one last review for next
    week. Naturally, Anna told us to read through the paper one more time to
    make sure we had everything.  </p>

    <p> I have to admit that I am sick of that paper, and I didn't look at it
    at all. It's good enough to turn in as it is, and I won't make it any
    better at this point. </p>

    <p> At the final meeting, we compared notes and found that we had no major
    changes to make. I took all four versions to make what few changes there
    were and submit it at the end of the week. For some reason, Anna didn't
    trust me, though, and asked me to send it to her first. What am I going to
    do &mdash; ruin it? Of course she still wanted me to put it together, she
    just wanted to make sure she's the one to submit it.  </p>

    <p> I am so glad this project is over and I hope I never wind up on a team
    with her again. Of course I said I'd do it, but I had to keep reminding
    myself that it was almost over. </p>

    <p> Making the changes went pretty quickly and I got her the paper the next
    day. I assume the paper went in on time as planned, and I imagine we'll get
    a good grade. </p>
