    <p> In group time the first week, we began by setting up weekly team
    meetings. The project is fairly open-ended, so we brainstormed topic ideas
    for the rest of the time. </p>

    <p> Iain had some really good ideas &mdash; it seems he's done this sort of
    thing before. John tried hard to be involved, but only suggested a couple
    of ideas and they were pretty mediocre. When Marie spoke, I sometimes
    wasn't sure if she was serious or not. Her suggestions were often funny,
    but I was too nervous to laugh &mdash; especially since no one else did.
    She definitely has a unique approach. Mostly, I just took it all in. Soon,
    we were building on each other's suggestions (mostly Iain's). </p>

    <p> Before the meeting ended, we narrowed it down to three ideas. Marie
    recommended we each look for resources on one topic, report back next time
    and then select a topic. This seemed like a good plan; Iain spoke first to
    claim a topic based upon a prior interest and John spoke up for another.
    After a moment, Marie took the last topic, but she didn't sound thrilled
    about it &mdash; I think it sounds like a tough one. I was left without a
    topic, so I volunteered to search for additional materials on Iain's topic
    because it sounded the most promising. </p>

    <p> After spending half an hour searching, I wasn't able to find much of
    anything. It was frustrating because Iain seemed so excited about it
    &mdash; I guess he's going to be disappointed. </p>

    <p> When I arrived, I felt uncomfortable because everyone had long lists of
    what they found and I had so little to offer. I asked how everyone found so
    much &mdash; especially Iain. He found so much more than I did on the same
    topic! He said that he'd got more than enough to start with and even
    offered to work with me after the meeting to help me. </p>

    <p> After reviewing the topics and the materials everyone found, there was
    some debate regarding which topic to focus on. Marie decided to start
    organizing things into lists of pros and cons to make it easier to
    understand; when she'd got some lists going, John's topic looked like the
    clear winner. We held a vote and decided on John's topic. This seemed like
    a good choice, but I could tell Iain was hoping that his would be selected.
    </p>

    <p> The materials John found were just the tip of the iceberg, so we
    divided up the major subtopics to research with summaries for next week.
    This way we'll be ready for the first assignment and be able to start
    moving quickly on getting this paper finished. </p>

    <p> I met with Iain two days later and he was still bummed about the topic
    the group selected, but he's nice and we got along well. He also seems to
    have much more experience than the rest of us do because, although he
    started with the same searches I did, he dug into the materials further to
    find related content. It took about two and a half hours, but we found some
    solid references. I went through them and wrote summaries, and then Iain
    verified them. I learned a lot and we both have a lot to bring to the next
    meeting. </p>

    <p> This week, we began sorting through the materials we'd all found.
    Together, Iain and I had easily the best materials and summaries to offer.
    Very little time needed to be spent covering our work because there weren't
    any questions. John's summaries, though, were difficult to understand and
    we needed his help in interpreting what he meant. It's not that the
    materials themselves were bad or anything, but he doesn't seem to have
    connected all the dots when writing them up. He was embarrassed and told us
    he'd rewrite them to make them clearer. Marie's summaries were interesting
    and some were funny, but I wasn't sure how exactly they fit in &mdash; and
    I don't think anyone else could see it, either. Honestly, she seems to need
    help understanding what we're doing, and everyone is afraid to tell her so.
    After some awkward moments, Iain asked a few direct but fair questions. As
    Marie tried to answer, it seemed that she was finally realizing that what
    she brought was really weak. He didn't push too hard though &mdash;
    probably didn't want to make her feel stupid. We decided to wait for our
    next meeting to review the new and updated materials from both Marie and
    John. </p>

    <p> I got to relax during the week without any tasks for this project. </p>

    <p> I slipped on some ice on my way to class and had to be rushed to the
    hospital to set a broken bone and get some stitches &mdash; it was pretty
    bad. They gave me some painkillers and I didn't react well to them. I
    completely forgot our team meeting until two days afterward, but by that
    point, I was working hard to try to make up for lost time in all my
    classes. John emailed me notes from the meeting and I did my best to try to
    put together my part of the paper, but I know it's not going to be close to
    perfect. I did spend a few hours on it, but it honestly wasn't my top
    priority. </p>

    <p> I didn't get to class, but I understand that John turned in the
    assignment for us. I was able to make it to the meeting this week and,
    naturally, everyone was surprised to see my cast. They were even more
    shocked that I'd brought a draft of my portion of the assignment. Of
    course, they didn't yet know that it wasn't very good. </p>

    <p> Iain seemed like he didn't care much this week and was a little bit
    mean toward Marie. He brought a draft of his portion, but it didn't look
    like he put much thought into it. There were a number of spots that read
    "to be determined" and I didn't see any citations or references. Marie
    almost seemed scared when the team reviewed her work, but I was actually
    impressed with how much she seems to have improved. Maybe that showed on my
    face; after she looked at me, she seemed to relax. John and I pointed out a
    number of rough spots, but I was no longer as nervous about her ability,
    and she was visibly relieved. Then it was my turn. I explained that my work
    was still incomplete, and it clearly was, but Marie said that, given the
    circumstances, even this much was great to have. We didn't spend much time
    on mine. John's writing was excellent this time. His thoughts were well
    articulated and he covered all the points he was supposed to &mdash; he
    must be putting a lot of time into this class. Throughout the meeting, Iain
    was really quiet &mdash; which is unusual for him. </p>

    <p> Marie suggested we each hand off our portion to another team member for
    a more thorough review. John volunteered to take Iain's and Iain, in turn,
    claimed John's. However, I still needed to take more time to finish my
    section, and Marie, reminding the group of some of Iain's early, insightful
    comments, asked that Iain look at her work. Marie took John's work for
    review. </p>

    <p> I was in much better shape this week and felt relatively caught up, so
    I spent about two hours finishing up my section and proofreading it. </p>

    <p> Iain was in class this week, but he emailed the team about an hour and
    a half before the meeting to say that there was a family emergency and that
    he would not be able to make it to the meeting. He sent over his progress
    on Marie's part of the paper. </p>

    <p> The meeting was fairly productive, as we were beginning to see the
    paper take shape. Marie took an odd approach to revising John's section and
    John seemed to agree, but Marie didn't push it and said she'd change it
    back for next week. The three of us spent a while just talking about how
    satisfied we were with the topic. There was a lot of information on it once
    we understood how to find it, and the consensus was that it's more
    interesting than any of us expected. Feeling like much of the paper was in
    good shape, I took the pieces home to assemble them into a full draft to
    use moving forward &mdash; Marie said she still had the earlier version of
    John's work and she'd give me that piece in the next day or so. </p>

    <p> Before the meeting broke up, John asked about switching next week's
    meeting time so he could meet with another study group. With mid-terms
    coming, everyone agreed that they needed extra time to prepare. However, we
    couldn't agree on a new time, so we decided to meet only for 30 minutes
    instead. Marie sent an email to let Iain know of the change. </p>

    <p> I spent two hours assembling and proofreading the document. </p>

    <p> I gave everyone a copy of the document I'd assembled when we started
    our meeting. After about 15 minutes of what was scheduled to be a 30-minute
    meeting, Iain had not arrived, so we decided to walk through the document
    together. </p>

    <p> John and Marie were vocal about how impressed they were. As the only
    one who had read everything through, I felt it was necessary to add a
    section &mdash; now just a placeholder. John suggested that Iain should
    write it and Marie joked that that would mean John would wind up writing
    it. They both chuckled, but I wasn't comfortable with it. It's true that
    Iain hasn't been doing his best work recently, but I still think they're
    being unfair. I reminded them that Iain helped me in the beginning (even
    though it might seem like ages ago) and maybe he was just really shaken up
    by whatever family emergency he went through. They both got quiet and we
    turned back to reviewing the document. </p>

    <p> Once we finished going through the document, the three of us agreed to
    review it and make notes/corrections/suggestions for next week. As we were
    all getting ready to leave, Iain popped in the door of the meeting room.
    Afraid they might say something mean, I quickly asked him if he was doing
    OK and what had happened. He said his brother was going through something.
    We made sure he had a copy and knew what we'd all be doing for next week.
    </p>

    <p> I did review the document, but I'd just put it together last week, so I
    didn't have much to add to it. </p>

    <p> Iain was already there when I arrived at the meeting this week. Marie
    has got a great eye for detail, as she found a ton of spelling and
    formatting errors that everyone else missed. I volunteered to take
    everyone's copies and make all the changes for the draft that we are to
    turn in next week in class. John pointed out the section that was still
    missing or incomplete. Iain said it was too late to get it into the draft
    but that it should be fine to include a note that it will be in the final
    version. He also made it clear that he wasn't writing it. Everyone else was
    uncomfortable with that approach. Marie volunteered to draft it and get it
    to me by the middle of the week. I figured I wouldn't have had the time to
    do both the writing and the editing, but this I can handle. I agreed to
    incorporate the new content if she got it to me in time. Iain offered Marie
    some good suggestions on how to approach the new content. </p>

    <p> It took about another hour to apply all the changes, and Marie got the
    new content to me in plenty of time to incorporate, as well. It probably
    took me an hour and a half. </p>

    <p> I forgot to provide copies to everyone before class and they seemed
    upset about it, but I did have one to turn in to the instructor. Now we get
    to wait for feedback. We do, however, already know of some work that needs
    done. </p>

    <p> Last week, Marie and John (who wound up collaborating on the new
    section) noticed some problems in the draft that needed to be corrected.
    Also, it seems Iain didn't do much at all on Marie's work &mdash; and John
    pointed out a number of areas that could be improved. As Iain was getting
    ready to leave for another meeting, Marie suggested that we add some
    diagrams to illustrate some of our points. The three of us sketched out
    concepts and when the group settled, it was clear that Marie was eager to
    take on this task. No one fought her for it. John offered to reread the
    entire document. The meeting ended early because Iain had another
    appointment to get to. </p>

    <p> I didn't have much to do this week for this class, so I got to focus on
    my other classes for a change. </p>

    <p> As I was on my way to the meeting, I heard from Iain. He told me that
    he'd just got free, front-row tickets to the game tonight, so he wouldn't
    be coming to our meeting. I can't believe he skipped another meeting, but
    there wasn't much I could do, so I told John and Marie when I got to our
    meeting.  </p>

    <p> John was already looking at the images Marie put together, and he
    didn't seem to like them much. They were a bit more artistic than we'd
    expected, but that's Marie! He said they were quirky (and they were), but
    they included all the right details to get the point across. They were
    functional but also eye-catching and memorable, and I said so. John seemed
    to still be a little uncomfortable with them and mentioned that he'd like
    Iain's opinion, but ultimately just made a few small requests. His changes
    would make the images less fun, but Marie and I both accepted them because
    they made John more comfortable. </p>

    <p> John made many changes to the document and some of them were pretty
    big. We walked through them at a high level and everyone agreed, so we
    moved on to prepare for the presentation. We worked out a basic structure
    for it and decided that we should each put together notes or a script for
    what we would say during our part so we could practice. I passed this on to
    Iain. </p>

    <p> Writing up this script took me a while, because I dread the thought of
    speaking in front of people. I managed to get something down, though. </p>

    <p> In class, our instructor returned the drafts to the groups and we met
    briefly during class to review it. Unfortunately, while we knew there were
    lots of problems with that version, the instructor only left five comments
    in our paper. I guess they wisely expected much of it to change since it
    was only a draft. One read "this shows promise," two corrected grammar
    issues, one requested that page numbers be added and one suggested we
    clarify that section Marie wrote initially, saying it was a novel approach
    and that it should therefore be explained more clearly and thoroughly. </p>

    <p> Everyone arrived on time for our meeting and the discussion began with
    how little feedback we got and whether this meant the paper was in great
    shape or that instructor simply didn't really read the whole thing. Either
    way, we had the feedback we'd been waiting for and it was time to move
    forward. </p>

    <p> Marie asked Iain to review her section again and he declined, saying
    that he'd already reviewed it once at her request. Marie responded with a
    snarky tone that she'd like him to "actually read it this time." This
    turned into an argument with Marie accusing Iain of not participating and
    Iain responding that her work was of low quality. John jumped in and
    defended Marie, saying that at least she was showing up and trying. At this
    point, I raised my voice and everyone quieted down. I reminded everyone of
    the upcoming presentation, and that yelling at each other wouldn't help us
    prepare. Iain argued that he didn't have time to go through the entire
    paper, but reluctantly agreed to take a look at Marie's section again by
    next week. </p>

    <p> The rest of the meeting was spent working through the presentation. The
    group used a PowerPoint Marie thought to put together in a practice run. We
    made a few adjustments, but it was nice to have it. Iain really seems to
    have put a lot of time into his part, and he sounded very polished. He also
    had lots of suggestions for the rest of us. By the end of the meeting, the
    presentation was still running too long &mdash; particularly John's part.
    He doesn't seem very experienced at this sort of thing. He included way too
    much and said it way too fast. He'll have to cut a bunch of it and
    practice, but with two weeks left, I still feel pretty good about it. </p>

    <p> I spent about half an hour revising my portion of the presentation
    during the week. </p>

    <p> Everyone arrived on time for the meeting this week. </p>

    <p> Iain provided feedback on Marie's section and, in reading through it,
    it became clear that making his changes would require changes throughout
    the paper. It was exactly the kind of feedback Marie wanted in the first
    place. However, so close to the end of class, it would be tough to make
    them, because no one in our group had the time to carry all the changes
    through &mdash; especially with everyone getting ready for final projects
    and exams. I can't believe he hasn't bothered to even read the paper until
    now. What we had wasn't wrong or anything, but these changes would make it
    stand out. I really don't understand why Iain didn't make the changes when
    he saw they were needed </p>

    <p> I volunteered to make the changes because I think they will make an
    impression on the instructor. I said I could find time to make the changes
    this week if someone else would read through it to make sure I didn't miss
    anything. John volunteered to do that.  </p>

    <p> The presentation was much better and, after three practice runs, it
    sounded smooth. While it was still running too long, we agreed that
    everyone would probably speak faster in class and the instructor probably
    wouldn't care if we ran over by a little. </p>

    <p> Making the changes took me about three hours that I really didn't have
    to spend, but at least it's done. </p>

    <p> The presentation went very smoothly. I was nervous, but I knew what I
    was talking about and I think that showed. The audience asked some good
    questions, which meant that they understood the presentation.  For some
    reason, Iain stepped forward to answer almost every question. It was like
    he was trying to show the instructor he'd done more than he actually did.
    Once, John started to answer and Iain seemed not to notice &mdash; he just
    went ahead and answered it himself. Also, we should have discussed clothes
    beforehand because we all dressed up except for John. He looked out of
    place in his usual jeans and a sweater. </p>

    <p> At our meeting, Iain commented on John's casual clothes, and John
    apologized. I felt it was unfair, because he was obviously already
    embarrassed about it.  He knew his part and was well prepared, and he has
    worked hard throughout the project. Aside from that, we all felt good about
    the work we'd done and I expect we'll get positive feedback and good
    grades. I shared my updated version of the paper and a quick review of the
    changes, but everyone knew what to expect and no one was surprised. John
    took it to do his review and we ended early because there wasn't much else
    to do. </p>

    <p> As we wrapped up, Marie asked John to send her a copy as soon as he was
    finished so she could take one last crack at it before we turn it in. </p>

    <p> At our final meeting, we reviewed the paper to make sure it was ready
    for submission at the end of the week. Iain volunteered to do a final read,
    print the document and send it to the instructor. Marie started to attack
    Iain for not helping the group &mdash; I think she felt like he was trying
    to steal credit for all our work at the end &mdash; just like he did in the
    presentation. John seemed tired and tried to calm her down and I joined
    him. John suggested that Marie submit the latest version she had at the
    deadline. If Iain could get his updates to her by that time, great, but
    otherwise she should use what she had. Iain was annoyed, but agreed. </p>

    <p> After the deadline, Marie confirmed that Iain got his changes to her in
    time for her to submit them, and she sent a copy of the finished product to
    the entire team. </p>
