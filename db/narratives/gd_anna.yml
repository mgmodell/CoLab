    <p> In group time the first week, we began by setting up weekly team
    meetings. The rest of my group are freshmen and they're all nervous about
    this "huge project" but, as a sophomore, I've already done lots of them.
    It's clear that if I don't provide a lot of guidance, I'll wind up writing
    everything myself at the end. </p>

    <p> The project looks fairly open-ended, so we brainstormed topic ideas for
    most of the time. I suggested some that I thought were pretty obvious and
    everyone seemed really impressed, so I told them I'd done this sort of
    project before. Jose tried to be involved, but the two ideas he suggested
    were pretty mediocre. When Sam spoke, I wasn't sure if he was serious or
    not. His suggestions were kind of funny, but I'm not sure that was his
    intent &mdash; he definitely has a unique approach. Kim mostly just
    listens; I guess she's shy or maybe just getting comfortable. Everyone
    focused on trying to improve on my suggestions. </p>

    <p> Before the meeting ended, we narrowed it down to five ideas. I
    recommended we each look for resources on one topic, report back next time
    and then select a topic, and everyone thought this was a pretty good idea.
    I spoke up for the topic that was most interesting to me &mdash; I'd
    already done some work on it for another class. Sam spoke for another and,
    after a moment, Jose took another &mdash; but he didn't sound thrilled
    about it. Kim said she'd take the last two, but that seemed like too much
    for her, so I said I'd take it. She surprised me by insisting, so we
    compromised and split it. She seems nice but hasn't said very much and I
    don't know what to make of her. </p>

    <p> The research for this week took me about an hour. I've got tons of
    materials on both topics because I was able to use some materials from the
    other class, as well. </p>

    <p> We began the meeting by going over the materials we'd collected over
    the last week, and it was very disappointing. I'm glad Kim and I split that
    last topic or the group would have junk for both of hers &mdash; she's
    clearly out of her depth. To be fair, though, it seems that neither Sam nor
    Jose did much better. There are some things that we can use, but I can see
    they barely read any of what they found. As a result, we spent most of the
    meeting talking about how I conducted my research and vetted the results.
    Sam didn't even understand why what he found wasn't useable, until I asked
    a few questions about the topic &mdash; things that we'd need to know for
    the paper &mdash; and where he found the answers. Of course, he could only
    answer one or two of them. I then went to my own notes and answered the
    same questions for the topics I took, and then he seemed to understand.
    </p>

    <p> When I pointed out that they should redo their research for next week,
    Sam actually suggested that the group just go with the topic I researched
    since I'd done such a good job with it (again, not sure if he was serious).
    I argued that this is obviously no good, because they still won't have any
    idea how to do the research &mdash; and this might not be the best topic
    for us, anyway. Ultimately, they agreed and decided to redo the research
    for next week. </p>

    <p> We ended early and Kim stopped me as I was about to leave. She told me
    she thought I was rude to Sam by laughing at him, and we had an argument. I
    explained that I wasn't being mean, I was just trying to help everyone get
    the most out of the class! I wasn't trying to be mean &mdash; I thought he
    was joking! I told her I'd try to be more sensitive in the future, and she
    was OK with it. </p>

    <p> Since my materials were fine, I didn't have anything to do this week,
    but I did spend about half an hour looking for materials for the other
    topics to help them out. </p>

    <p> In this week's meeting, we sorted through the materials we'd got to
    evaluate them and decide on a topic, but it was tough to come to agreement.
    They'd all brought better materials this week. I feel like I never should
    have pushed them to redo their research, because Sam came back loving his
    topic, even though the materials available for it were pretty weak. Even
    worse &mdash; he convinced Kim to agree. I don't know how that happened,
    because I pointed out that the materials available were really thin and
    there really wasn't much on which to base a paper. On the other hand, Jose,
    who didn't much like his own topic, agreed that the topic I'd initially
    selected was the best of them &mdash; it's got the best resources
    available, as well. The discussion went on for most of the scheduled
    meeting time, and ultimately the group settled on the topic I'd researched.
    I'm not positive that Sam's really on board, but he did say 'ok.' </p>

    <p> After the topic was settled, I started drafting our outline and
    everyone joined in. It became clear pretty quickly that I'd have to teach
    them how to structure a paper properly. Even afterward, Sam proposed some
    odd ideas that he said would make it more interesting. I had to explain
    that, while that was great for fiction, this was needed to be professional.
    Again, he gave in, but I'm not sure that meant he agreed. Jose suggested we
    split up the source materials among ourselves, look for a few more, write
    what we can about them and bring that back next week. It wasn't a bad idea,
    but as soon as I started assigning them, everyone got upset with how I was
    doing it, so I asked them to claim one they wanted until there were none
    left. This worked pretty well, but Jose took one that was really too
    complicated and difficult, so I offered to help with it; this seemed to
    upset him. </p>

    <p> I spent about another hour taking notes this week. I took some notes on
    that piece for Jose, but he never did get in touch with me to work on it,
    so I figured I'd bring them to class and give them to him there. </p>

    <p> Jose was obnoxious in class about the notes I'd put together to help
    him. When I handed them to him after class, he looked at me like I was
    crazy. I don't get it, but he did take them. </p>

    <p> Jose and Sam were late to the meeting this week, but that's not such a
    big deal. What wasn't OK was that Sam forgot to write summaries for two of
    the five parts he was supposed to bring! No one else seemed to care until I
    reminded them that we only had one week left before we turned it in. It's a
    shame, because he did a great job with what he did write. Jose seems to
    have completely ignored all the notes I gave him and a quick glance at his
    summaries shows that he doesn't understand what we're doing with this
    paper. It's not garbage, but there is a lot of work left to do. Kim did an
    OK job on her parts, but, while they are OK for next week, they are on the
    short side and she didn't think about the outline at all or where her
    summaries might fit into it. It's going to take a lot of work to build this
    out into a paper.  </p>

    <p> Naturally, everyone was surprised to see my summaries because they were
    much more complete. Also, no one else had thought to include pointers to
    the sections where they should be used in our outline. Unfortunately, with
    this due next week, there's no time for them to fix theirs. Sam said he'd
    put everything together for what we need to turn in, since he still has to
    write a lot of his materials. I told him to send it to me so I could look
    at it before we turn it in. </p>

    <p> Next we talked about the outline and Kim had some really good ideas for
    improving it. Everyone agreed, but Sam complained that it was too much for
    him to do for next week and asked that we just make a note of it and make
    the changes later, but this won't get us the feedback we need from the
    instructor. Anyway, he's the one who didn't do his work for this week...
    Kim stepped up, however, and offered to make the changes if Sam could get
    the rest of it done by the middle of the week. Sam agreed. I really hope I
    can trust them to do it right. </p>

    <p> Before we left, I reminded everyone that we need a completed draft
    ready in another four weeks and that they should build out their summaries
    to look more like mine for next week. From the looks on their faces, it
    seemed no one else realized this was necessary, but no one argued. </p>

    <p> There wasn't much for me to do this week outside of the meeting, so I
    focused on my other classwork. </p>

    <p> Kim was a little late, but turned in our paper in in class. After
    class, the instructor allowed some time to meet for group work, and we
    reviewed Sam and Kim's work &mdash; they explained that they met up in the
    middle of last week after Sam had done his part and worked on finishing
    everything up together. There wasn't a lot of time in class and it looked
    ok. I pointed to a few problems, but there weren't a lot of comments. </p>

    <p> Everyone was happy to see the paper starting to take shape and we
    discussed what we should do next. Sam suggested that we each build out the
    summaries we'd been working on, but I had to point out that that wouldn't
    work, because some of them would appear all throughout the paper. I was
    about to speak, but Jose had arrived and heard us talking about what came
    next. He said we should just wait for the feedback from our instructor,
    anyway. He argued that we should take the week off, instead! The worst part
    was that Kim and Sam also thought this was a good idea.  </p>

    <p> I had to explain that the first assignment was basically just to make
    sure we were moving forward. I also told them that, in my experience, it
    often took weeks for them to get this sort of thing back to us; if we
    waited on that, we'd never have the draft completed in time. I can't
    believe they didn't know! Also, it's getting toward mid-term time and we'll
    appreciate the extra time to study later if we finish most of this now.
    </p>

    <p> I told them we have to keep moving to get this done. That meant
    splitting the paper into four pieces and each of us taking one &mdash; we
    could save the introduction and conclusion to be written after the rest is
    in place. Eventually they agreed to this. </p>

    <p> I took the last quarter of the paper and spent a lot of time working on
    it this week. The topics in this part were mostly done by Sam and Jose, and
    I had to fix many major problems with Jose's work. He's trying, but doesn't
    really get it. I had to review a bunch of the materials to see what they
    were really saying and then redo everything. He misinterpreted the
    materials and was therefore arguing the wrong point. He probably won't even
    recognize much of this as his work. </p>

    <p> Sam and Kim were again there when I arrived this week, but Jose was
    not. We started by looking at Kim's work. It was well written and she's
    made some good observations that I hadn't even thought of. We spent some
    time exploring those observations further, and it gave me some ideas to add
    to mine. Sam's looks fantastic because he included some great visuals that
    made it easy to understand what he was trying to say &mdash; he should be
    an illustrator. This started us talking about where else we might be able
    to add images to strengthen our paper. We came up with a diagram and a
    graph that would really help, and Kim volunteered to take the graph, but I
    don't want her to be overloaded since I'll probably ask her to do much of
    the proofreading and formatting. Plus, Sam's obviously good at it. So I
    asked him to do them both, and he seemed happy. </p>

    <p> Then Jose showed up, about fifteen minutes late, saying his coach had
    been holding the team late to prepare for their upcoming game. We moved on
    to the part of the paper I'd rewritten and Jose was angry because he didn't
    understand why I changed his part of it. I said that what he had put
    together had helped me orient myself, but that I'd had to make some changes
    so it would all make sense and work toward the same vision. He responded
    that it was my vision and not the group's. Then Kim spoke up to say that
    even though the paper is much different from what she thought it would be,
    it was clear that I had a lot of experience and that the paper was turning
    out well. After that, Jose admitted that he was going in a different
    direction and asked us to think about writing the paper that way &mdash; he
    thought it was valid. So we talked about the problems we might run into
    (not the least of which being that we'd have to do a major rewrite).
    Ultimately, he gave up and stayed on the same path, of course. Obviously,
    we didn't look at Jose's work because he would have to make some major
    changes to it, anyway. </p>

    <p> Since none of their pieces are really finished and I had some things I
    wanted to add to mine (thanks, Kim!), we decided to each spend another week
    with our own parts. I volunteered to write the introduction and conclusion,
    as well. My own additions took me longer than expected &mdash; I spent
    about an hour on it. </p>

    <p> Jose was late again this week. It was only about five minutes this
    time, but it's getting to be a habit and he said the game was last week, so
    I asked him to please try to be on time in the future; he glared at me. He
    reminded me that his coach has been keeping him longer lately and then
    added that it didn't matter because I was doing the whole project anyway
    &mdash; that it didn't make much difference if he was there or not. How am
    I supposed to respond to that? I reminded him that it's a group project and
    that we're all working toward a shared grade on this. Really! Am I supposed
    to apologize for being more experienced? Kim stepped in at this point to
    calm Jose down. She confirmed, and asked me to confirm that we were working
    as equals on a group project. </p>

    <p> Everyone's pieces looked much better this week &mdash; especially
    Jose's, which was pretty much entirely rewritten. While Sam's very good
    with visuals, his writing skills leave a lot to be desired. At first, I was
    making a lot of comments and corrections, but then I gave up and told him
    that I'd take it and fix it for next week. He was fine with that. Everyone
    seemed to be pretty happy with the way the paper was turning out, in fact
    &mdash; even Jose. </p>

    <p> I suggested that maybe we might want to trade pieces to proofread for
    next week and then end early. Nobody was opposed to this, and I'd already
    volunteered to take Sam's work. Kim said she'd assemble the four pieces for
    next week so we could see the whole thing together. I wasn't comfortable
    with this because we would all be looking at our pieces separately this
    week, and it wasn't fair to make her do all of that. However, she pointed
    out that we could still make our edits to the pieces in the larger paper
    and she was volunteering to make the changes in the final document, too.
    So, since I couldn't think of any good reason why we shouldn't, we went
    with it. </p>

    <p> Jose asked that we change our meeting time for next week because he has
    some study sessions to attend. Sam asked if we might even be able to cancel
    it, since we've all got mid-terms coming up and our paper is looking like
    it's in pretty good shape; Kim agreed with him. Naturally, no one
    remembered that it was my planning and organization that put us in such a
    good position. We decided to change next week's meeting to fifteen minutes
    immediately after class; it will be primarily to pass around the updated
    document and our corrections. </p>

    <p> It took me a while to get through Sam's work, and I had to rework a lot
    of it. All told, it took me about an hour. </p>

    <p> During this week's class, some of the discussion touched on the topic
    of our paper, and Jose and Sam both were active in the discussion. This
    lead to some lively debate, and it became clear that there were competing
    points of view within the classroom. </p>

    <p> After class, we met briefly as we decided last week. Kim did a good job
    of not only integrating her own work into the paper, but cleaning things up
    in general. She seems to have a real knack for that. She moved some things
    around throughout the paper, and it's a real improvement. She's also
    applied the formatting throughout the document and it's looking good. Jose
    and Sam were also impressed. Kim put a lot of work into it. The changes
    made it difficult, however, to distinguish one piece from the other. We
    decided we should look through our high-level comments and feedback to see
    what still makes sense to incorporate, and then hand the detail work back
    to Kim to apply in the new version. Most of the changes ended up being work
    that Kim had already done. </p>

    <p> Then, Sam brought up the class discussion and asked what we should do
    about addressing the other viewpoints. While we probably should mention
    them, Jose looked at this as some sort of vindication of where he was going
    originally (that I corrected). Worse yet, Sam agreed! Our existing approach
    showed we are creative and thoughtful, rather than just parrots of the
    textbooks. When the discussion stretched on, I suggested that maybe we
    should hold our regularly-scheduled meeting to finish the discussion. No
    one wanted to do that. I offered instead to add in a note explaining the
    other perspective, and Sam really liked this idea. He explained that he
    really likes the direction we've taken the paper, but that he was nervous
    that we'd look like we'd completely missed that alternative perspective.
    He's got a really good point, too. This got Jose on board, but he wanted to
    write it. I said no way! His other work has been sloppy, and I said I
    wouldn't risk turning in something unfinished, even if it is just a draft.
    Kim told him that if he could get it to her by mid-week, she'd include it
    in the draft she was preparing. On our way out, I caught Kim and asked her
    to be sure to keep the note brief. </p>

    <p> I didn't have anything to do outside of class this week, so I focused
    on my other class work. </p>

    <p> Kim had our paper ready to be submitted when she arrived in class, and
    she also brought a copy for each of us to look at afterward, but we didn't
    meet because both Sam and Jose had already left. I was really hoping to
    have a chance to go through it together, but that was probably best because
    it gave me a chance to look over the whole paper. Although it integrates
    nicely, I thought that Kim would keep Jose's brief note brief; instead, it
    adds almost a full page. </p>

    <p> About ten minutes into the meeting, I started to get up and leave
    because I was the only one there. Just then, Jose arrived and asked why I
    was leaving. It seems that Kim told Jose and Sam she'd be late to the
    meeting, so they decided to just meet later instead &mdash; but no one
    thought to tell me. When everyone finally arrived, I tried not to make a
    big deal, but I was pretty upset. </p>

    <p> I pulled out my own changes to the document and no one questioned any
    of them. They were mostly minor at this point, but I did trim down some of
    Jose's note. No one said anything. I asked them to please take another look
    at the paper this week, but I doubt they will.  If they do, they probably
    won't see anything. I guess everyone is exhausted. Maybe they hate me? </p>

    <p> Our next task was to begin preparing for the presentation. We drafted
    an initial PowerPoint, and they all just accepted the assignments that I
    suggested &mdash; they pretty much followed the parts of the paper they'd
    each written. I expected there to be some discussion, so I asked if
    everyone was OK with it. They said it was fine, so I guess they are. We all
    agreed to start working on our talking points and our slides in the deck.
    </p>

    <p> I am very comfortable with my topic, but that translated into it
    running about twice as long as it should. It took me two nights to get it
    to something workable because I had a lot of other projects to work on,
    too, and I just couldn't focus. </p>

    <p> We spent the first fifteen minutes practicing our presentation &mdash;
    the one that's only supposed to take seven minutes! Have none of these
    people ever presented anything before? Jose talked for five minutes about
    everything but his topics before he introduced Sam. Sam, in turn, had the
    smart idea to add the diagrams to the slides, but then proceeded to
    describe the images, rather than the story they are supposed to tell. I
    have no idea what Kim was talking about since she seems to be so petrified
    of public speaking that her voice never got up above a whisper. By
    comparison, I thought mine was pretty decent. I may not be the best
    presenter, but at least I stayed on topic and close to the time limit. </p>

    <p> We spent the rest of the meeting working on the presentations.
    Fortunately, I wasn't the only one criticizing and pointing out flaws. Each
    of us (including me) took home a bunch of things to work on before the next
    meeting if this presentation is going to run smoothly. I have to slow down
    and rework a few phrases that didn't make sense to them when they heard it.
    Also, after seeing what Sam put together, I've got some ideas for improving
    my slides. </p>

    <p> I actually spent another hour and a half just practicing my part
    &mdash; and that was after about half an hour of reworking. </p>

    <p> In class, the instructor returned the drafts to the groups, and we met
    briefly during class to review it. The instructor left only six comments in
    our paper &mdash; glad we didn't wait on that! One comment read,
    "Interesting approach! I like that you reached beyond what we did in
    class." The comments clearly favored the results of my guidance (in
    contrast with the direction Jose was pushing for). Another comment
    complimented the images. One of the comments indicated a need to further
    develop a section and another asked us to recheck one of our references.
    </p>

    <p> Our meeting opened up very strangely, as Jose completely misinterpreted
    the instructor's comment. He thought the instructor was complimenting the
    fact that the document took what we talked about in class a bit further. It
    took me a while to understand that's what he was thinking and then I tried
    to gently help him understand the truth. Eventually he said he understood,
    but I'm not sure that he really did. Sam and Kim both stayed out of that
    disagreement and were quick to move on afterward. I told them that I'd make
    the requested changes this week because I'd already started. </p>

    <p> The presentations were better this week, but we still need more
    practice and a bunch of rework. Jose changed his part in response to what
    he thought the instructor was saying, but I'm not sure I can convince him
    to fix it completely. He did say he'd change it some to make sure it's
    still in line with what everyone else wrote, and I guess this is OK. We do
    have the note in the paper, so I guess he's got that covered. Sam and Kim
    had both fixed some parts of theirs, but we spent most of the meeting
    fixing other parts. We also talked about how we should dress for the
    presentation. Kim had an elaborate costume idea that was completely
    unprofessional (and I hate dressing up in costumes). I said business
    casual. When we ended the meeting, I reminded everyone that our
    presentation is in just two weeks. </p>

    <p> Reworking the paper this week took me about two hours, but I didn't
    mind. If I hadn't done it, it probably would have been wrong. Also, the
    instructor was right about the reference &mdash; I'll have to ask Sam what
    happened with that and if he's able to track down the correct reference.
    I'm glad my part of the presentation is finished now. </p>

  text: |
    <p> We had to start without Kim this week because she left a message with
    Jose that she'd be late due to a meeting for another class. The group spent
    some time reviewing my changes to the paper. I asked Sam about the
    incorrect reference and he just laughed and rifled through his notes. He
    explained that it was just a placeholder he threw in while he was writing,
    and he never got around to removing it. It's pretty funny that it stayed in
    this long without anyone noticing. I continued and both of them were fine
    with my fixes. </p>

    <p> Kim arrived just as I finished looking at the changes. She asked to
    take another look, but I asked her to look at it after the meeting,
    instead, so that we would have time to practice the presentation again.
    None of them made many changes &mdash; even Sam, and that's annoying
    &mdash; but the presentation felt much better this week. They must have
    practiced a lot. After two practice runs, it sounded smooth. While it's
    still running too long, we agreed that everyone will probably speak faster
    in class and the instructor probably won't be a stickler on time. </p>

    <p> We decided to end early this week. I reminded everyone to wear formal
    business clothes to the presentation next week. </p>

    <p> I practiced a few more times this week, but mostly I was free again to
    work on my other coursework. </p>

    <p> We were the only group dressed professionally, and I think that
    probably earned us some points. Kim managed to speak loudly and clearly
    enough that the instructor only had to ask her to speak up once. Jose
    stumbled on his first few sentences, but he quickly relaxed and did a great
    job. The biggest surprise, though was Sam: he added an analogy at the end
    that not only tied everything together, but it also made everyone laugh. It
    was unexpected and risky, but it worked out well. There weren't a lot of
    questions for us, and I stepped forward to direct them to the best person
    to answer. </p>

    <p> I think we can expect positive feedback and good grades.  </p>

    <p> Since the paper is mostly finished, we all decided to skip this week's
    meeting and each give the paper one last review for the following week.
