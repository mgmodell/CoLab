    <p> In group time, we began by setting up weekly team meetings. My group
    seems to be nice, and Anika and I shared one of our big lecture courses
    last semester. Lionel says he just transferred into this school. The
    project is pretty big and fairly open-ended, so we brainstormed topic ideas
    for the rest of the time. </p>

    <p> Anika was pretty quiet &mdash; maybe she suggested an idea or two.
    Everyone else seemed to have a lot to say, though. Natasha's ideas almost
    always made me laugh. She seems to be working hard to get outside the box
    and mostly she did it. This meant that many of her ideas weren't really
    useable, but they were fun and often they helped me to come up with other
    ideas, too. Toward the end of our meeting, Lionel noticed that no one was
    taking notes, so we recounted the ideas we could remember while he wrote
    them down and we discussed those 14 ideas. </p>

    <p> Before the meeting ended, we crossed off the ones that didn't seem to
    work (this got rid of most of Natasha's) and ultimately narrowed it down to
    six. I recommended we each look for resources on all the topics to get
    familiar with them. Next week, we will report back and select a topic.
    Everyone agreed with this, so we had a plan. </p>

    <p> After searching for about half an hour, it was pretty clear that only
    two of the topics really work for this project, so I focused on those. I
    figure that if we are all working on this independently, we are likely to
    come up with many of the same materials, so I tried not to spend too much
    time on the ones I found easily, but rather to dig deeper instead. </p>

    <p> Anika found a lot of materials for one of the topics that I had a rough
    time with, but Lionel and Natasha also focused on the same two as me. We
    ended up with a lot of duplication, but at least we all know those topics.
    When we dug into what Anika found for the third topic, I couldn't see how
    we would be able to use much of it &mdash; the research mostly just had
    mentions of what we needed. Even Anika seemed to mostly dismiss the topic,
    and our discussion quickly centered on our most promising two topics. </p>

    <p> There was a lot of discussion about which to choose &mdash; everyone
    had an opinion. Then Natasha suggested that we try to combine them. We
    wasted about ten minutes trying to see if we could make that work, but
    ultimately we couldn't and wound up back where we started. Our first vote
    was split down the middle, so I decided to make a list of pros and cons. I
    may have conveniently skewed the list in favor of my preference, but either
    way, our next vote was unanimous. Alex immediately pointed out that the
    other topic, although more exciting on the surface, would have probably
    been much more complicated and difficult. </p>

    <p> The obvious next step was to find more materials on our selected topic,
    so we figured out the major subtopics and divided them amongst ourselves.
    We decided everyone would return next week with summaries of what they'd
    found to make it easier for the group to get moving quickly. To make sure
    we didn't wind up with a million competing summaries for the many duplicate
    materials, I split up the materials we'd already got among us. </p>

    <p> I found some more materials and then spent about half an hour writing
    those summaries. The project would be big, but it is pretty straightforward
    so far. </p>

    <p> During our meeting, we began sorting through the materials. Lionel's
    and Natasha's materials were in good shape. At one point, Natasha misread
    one of Lionel's summaries and made everyone laugh, but it was a pretty
    lucky mistake. In the ensuing conversation, a whole new light was shone on
    the topic. I'm not sure if that's what Natasha intended, but if so, it was
    brilliant.  </p>

    <p> I guess I should have spent more time writing because no one understood
    what I wrote. I'm not used to working in groups, and I guess I forget to
    explain everything. I just wrote down my observations (which, in this case,
    I could have used to write my own paper), but it wasn't complete and I had
    to explain it for the rest of the group. They did like my observations,
    though! I told them I'd rework them for next week.  </p>

    <p> Anika's summaries, on the other hand, were just a sentence or two each.
    Initially, she seemed to think they would be useful to us. After some
    awkward questions, I asked her point blank if she'd prefer to use Natasha's
    summaries or her own to write the paper, and she understood. The question
    was a bit blunt, but if Anika was offended, she didn't show it. I suspect
    it helped that we all had things to do to improve our work for next week.
    </p>

    <p> I restructured my summaries this week to look more like summaries than
    my own notes. When I was done, I asked my roommate to take a look, and he
    had a few good questions that I subsequently addressed. All told, it took
    me about an hour and forty-five minutes. </p>

    <p> Lionel was a bit late to the meeting this week, but Anika wasn't there
    at all. She hadn't been in class and no one had heard anything from her, so
    we weren't sure what was going on.  </p>

    <p> When it looked like she wouldn't be coming, we began working through my
    updated materials. Lionel and Natasha were both much happier this time.
    Lionel pointed out that they could use some editing, but that they were
    much improved. He made a point of saying he really liked some of the
    observations I'd made. He volunteered to try to redo Anika's work and
    assemble what we had for the assignment due next week, but Natasha said
    she'd work on Anika's part and get it to him so he could include them. She
    said she didn't want him overloaded. She also asked me to put together a
    basic outline of what the paper should look like. What a smart idea! </p>

    <p> Putting together the outline didn't really take a whole lot of time.

    <p> Lionel turned in our assignment this week in class and Anika was there,
    too. It seems she'd had to go home in a rush because her mother went to the
    hospital, but she had done her summaries and got them to Lionel in time for
    him to include them in what he turned in. Our instructor gave us some time
    to meet as a group at the end of class, and we spent the time looking at my
    outline. Lionel seemed to be satisfied with it, but Anika and Natasha
    weren't. I wasn't really sure what they didn't like because we didn't have
    much time to get into it, but I tried to make some changes that evening.
    </p>

    <p> At our meeting, it took a while to really understand where we weren't
    connecting. I thought the two of them were looking for me to make some
    changes to what I had, but it turned out they had completely different
    ideas of where this was going &mdash; from each other as well as from me!
    Lionel seemed to be confused and stayed out of our discussion. I think he
    figured it was all a simple misunderstanding that'd get worked out quickly,
    but he managed to be very involved in the conversation because his face is
    very expressive. It was clear that he was being swayed by Natasha. So was
    I, for that matter. After about half an hour, we modified the outline to
    look more like what Natasha was describing. Even Anika reluctantly agreed
    that it was probably the right way to go. </p>

    <p> With the outline settled, Anika suggested we split the outline up into
    quarters and each write one for next week. Lionel spoke up quickly for the
    second section and I took the third because I didn't want to write the
    introduction or the conclusion. Fortunately, Natasha took the former and
    Anika took the latter. </p>

    <p> It took me about two hours to write my draft of the paper because I
    just couldn't seem to make everything work properly. I finally stopped when
    I had something, but it's hardly my best work. It just doesn't seem to all
    fit properly. </p>

    <p> It seems that no one was really able to make the pieces work quite
    right, so we had to rethink our approach. I had a feeling Anika would bring
    up her idea from last week, and she did. Fortunately, I'd thought a lot
    about that when I ran into trouble writing and was quickly able to point
    out where and how we'd run into the same problems her way. Lionel listened
    for a bit and then suggested that we try something that he had used on a
    past project; it was a really good idea. It would, of course, require some
    adaptation, but it could work out very well for us.  </p>

    <p> Natasha and Anika joined in, and we ironed it out together. It was sort
    of exciting, really. In spite of it being his idea, Lionel seemed to be
    nervous about suggesting anything, but he also contributed. About halfway
    into our meeting, we started looking back at the pieces we'd already
    written and seeing if/where they still fit. It looked like we would be left
    with about half a paper still to write. </p>

    <p> This time, we each took pieces that were left to write. Anika and
    Natasha fought a bit over who took one of the tricky parts, but ultimately
    we all wound up with pieces we could handle. </p>

    <p> A few days later, Lionel asked if I could help him out with one of his
    pieces. I felt bad because I hadn't started any of my writing, but of
    course I said yes. We worked on it for about an hour and he answered all
    his own questions, so I don't know why he needed me.  </p>

    <p> When we moved on to my work, he couldn't understand any of what I'd
    thrown together that morning. I knew it needed work, but it was also nice
    to have him pointing out exactly where. Sometimes it's tough to see what
    you're thinking through other people's eyes. I am pretty sure he helped me
    more than I helped him, and I told him so, but he probably didn't believe
    me &mdash; he really doesn't think he's very smart. </p>

    <p> I was a bit late because one of my instructors offered to run a study
    session to prepare for the midterms, and I desperately needed the help. I
    felt bad that I forgot to tell the group last week, but when I arrived I
    learned that everyone else had been late for similar reasons. </p>

    <p> In spite of this, everyone was happier with what we had this week and,
    after running through what we had, the paper was starting to look pretty
    good. We spent much of our time assembling the pieces into a single paper.
    When we did, we realized that neither the introduction nor the conclusion
    worked very well any longer. Natasha asked Lionel to write the
    introduction, because the new structure of the paper was his idea, but I
    think he honestly doesn't understand that it was true. He actually denied
    it &mdash; and I don't think it was because he didn't want to write the
    piece. When he said he'd do it, he made Anika promise that she'd review it
    the following week.  </p>

    <p> I volunteered to rework the conclusion, but Natasha asked me instead to
    proofread and format the document, while she rewrote the conclusion. Anika
    didn't have anything for the week, and I think she didn't want to feel like
    a slacker, so she said she'd proofread the document, as well &mdash; just
    to have an extra set of eyes on it.  </p>

    <p> Natasha also told us she'd be late next week because one of her
    midterms would run until the start of this meeting. </p>

    <p> Proofreading took me awhile. It's a good paper, but you can tell it was
    written by four different people. I found lots of little things, but there
    were a few things that will need major rework. One part of what Natasha had
    written probably made sense when she wrote it, but the instructor
    completely contradicted it in class, so we'll have to completely rewrite
    that piece. </p>

    <p> I thought the group would be bummed that I was so nitpicky, but they
    were thrilled I'd found so much stuff. Anika found good stuff, too, but I
    had almost everything she did and then about half again as many. We decided
    that we couldn't make the bigger changes in time for the draft that's due
    next week. We will be able to write it, but everyone has tight schedules
    this week. We can't get it written and give anyone else a chance to take a
    look at it before we have to turn it in; no one felt that would be OK. </p>

    <p> Natasha showed up just as we finished going through the fixes to the
    paper. Next we looked at Lionel's introduction and Anika immediately asked
    what everyone was thinking: why was it so short? Lionel just shrugged and
    we all read it. As it turned out, Anika shouldn't have said anything before
    she read it &mdash; it covered everything it needed to and was pretty good.
    Neither Natasha nor I had any ideas for improving it. I think Anika
    felt like she had to do something, so after she thought about it for a
    moment, she agreed that nothing was missing, but said she had some ideas
    for beefing it up a bit. A few minutes later we had a new version that was
    longer and felt a bit more complete. It was good, but not really necessary.
    I suggested making a part of what Natasha added a bit more concise. </p>

    <p> When we were done, Anika said she'd add in the conclusion, make the
    changes we talked about and have a version of the paper ready to turn in
    next week in class. Natasha said that she'd try to make the larger changes
    that I'd suggested. Lionel volunteered to start building a PowerPoint for
    the upcoming presentation. I felt bad, but asked if anyone minded if I took
    the week off because I had to prepare for a late midterm next week in my
    toughest subject. No one minded. </p>

    <p> This week I did nothing for this class outside of our meeting. </p>

- !ruby/object:Week_
  week_num: 9
  text_ko:  
  text_en: |
    <p> Anika not only brought a copy of our paper to class for the instructor,
    but also brought copies for each of us to look at between class and our
    meeting. This way, we didn't waste our meeting time on reading through it.
    As an added bonus, Natasha had merged her changes into this latest version.
    Unfortunately, she'd had a difficult time making those changes and they
    were not complete. She brought a list of questions and possible answers,
    and we spent a good twenty minutes on that before we came to any answers.
    At some point while I was listening, I had a fantastic idea so I said I'd
    take it home and work on it for next week. No one argued with me. </p>

    <p> Next we discussed the presentation &mdash; beginning with the
    PowerPoint Lionel had put together. Before Anika could comment (because she
    always does), Lionel pointed out that this was just a start and that he
    knew there wasn't much to it. He recommended that everyone claim a few
    slides and modify them when they worked on what they were going to say. At
    this, Anika just shut her mouth and I have to admit, that was pretty
    satisfying. She's not mean or anything, but it was nice to not hear her
    being critical for once.  </p>

    <p> Natasha chose a few slides, including the first one, but Lionel said he
    wanted to introduce us. I was a bit surprised, because I didn't figure he'd
    volunteer for such a visible role. Ultimately, we decided that they'd both
    give it a shot and see which one we like best when we practice next week.
    I'm actually excited about making it into a bit of a competition. </p>

    <p> I enjoy public speaking, so I spent a long time iterating over my
    talking points for our presentation. My roommate is probably sick of
    hearing it, but I feel good about the presentation. </p>

  week_num: 10
  text_ko:  
  text_en: |
    <p> I liked my presentation, but Anika and Natasha both had some ideas for
    improvement. One of Anika's ideas was really a good one, but most of them
    were sort of picky. It's no big deal, though &mdash; while I don't think
    the ideas really improve anything, they won't hurt either, so I'll make
    them.  </p>

    <p> Anika and Natasha both presented well, and they took home a lot of
    feedback, as well. Frankly, I'm pretty sure my presentation was better than
    either of theirs. I know that we aren't competing against each other and we
    all have to do well, but it felt good to know that mine was good &mdash; no
    matter what they said. </p>

    <p> Lionel on the other hand&hellip; I don't know what was going on there!
    It looked like this was his first time building a PowerPoint, and he spent
    all his time playing with his new toy! There were animations and images and
    words flying in and out. Every slide was completely different, too. The
    worst part was that he just read all the words off the slide! Everyone
    &mdash; especially Anika &mdash; had a lot of feedback for him. I think we
    should have been a bit gentler with him; although he's really bright, he
    doesn't seem to know it. I could see on his face that took it really hard.
    </p>

    <p> Needless to say, it wasn't much of a competition. Natasha's
    introduction was much better than his and we had to go with her for it. I
    think she might use some of his visual ideas, though &mdash; it looks like
    he spent a bunch of time cropping our heads for the main slide and it was
    pretty nice (if also a bit cheesy). </p>

    <p> After the meeting ended and Natasha and Anika left, I offered to work
    with him and help him with his presentation, but he said no. I think he was
    embarrassed. I hope I didn't make him feel worse. </p>

    <p> In class, the instructor returned the drafts and we met briefly during
    class to review it. There weren't many comments, and most of them were
    pretty minor or issues that Natasha had already fixed. However, there was
    one comment that concerned us all: a diagram might help here. I can't
    believe that this was the first time I realized that we were presenting our
    instructor with a great big wall of text_ko:  
    text_en! How could we have missed that?
    We'd definitely have things to talk about at this week's team meeting. </p>

    <p> Lionel arrived a bit late as we were talking about our complete lack of
    images. However, while we were still at the complaining-about-it stage, he
    was way ahead of us. He actually apologized as he pulled out a bunch of
    sketches he'd "thrown together." They were fantastic! His were done with
    pencil on scraps of paper and Natasha copied them over with black pen on
    full sheets so they were crisper and easier to see. We worked on them for
    about half an hour, making small changes here and there. Natasha
    volunteered create new versions to include in the document. </p>

    <p> We spent the rest of the meeting working through the presentation and
    everyone sounded better this week &mdash; especially Lionel. It was like he
    was a completely different person. We all commented on the dramatic
    improvement. I'm not sure he quite believed it, but there was some relief
    on his face. He was also more active in providing feedback to everyone
    else. He pointed out that I'd included something that wasn't actually in
    our paper. I told him where I'd found it and he seemed glad, but not
    satisfied. He asked if we wanted to talk in the presentation about
    something that we didn't mention in the paper. Natasha and Anika didn't
    think it was a big deal, but he clearly felt like it's a bad idea. He
    wouldn't let it go, but he wasn't saying I needed to take it out &mdash; he
    was asking where we should add it to the paper. I told him that I didn't
    think it was a big deal and also that I didn't have time to do it. So, he
    said that he'd add it into the paper himself. Problem solved! </p>

    <p> I practiced some more for the presentation, but mostly left this class
    alone because I'm pretty sure we are in good shape. However, after giving
    it a lot of thought, I realized that Lionel had a good point. I removed
    that piece that we spent so much time discussing in the meeting. It
    tightened things up a bit to do so and wasn't really needed. </p>

    <p> Lionel's images really added a lot to our paper, making it easier for
    people to understand parts of it. Lionel also claimed one of the images for
    one of his slides, and it worked much better than the bullet points he'd
    had on there. I can't believe we didn't have any images in at all until
    now. </p>

    <p> This week, the presentation was much better and after another three
    practice runs, it sounded smooth. Anika managed to slow down quite a lot. I
    think Lionel was a little bit frustrated to find that, after our argument
    last week, I'd removed the bit he added into the paper. I probably should
    have told him when I made that decision. Natasha added the photos of us to
    her introduction slide, and they looked pretty good. Finally, and arguably
    most importantly, we managed to cut it down to the correct time. </p>

    <p> I practiced a few more times during the week when I was able to find a
    moment here and there. </p>

    <p> The presentation went OK, but not quite as smoothly as I'd hoped. I was
    nervous and I think I didn't speak as loudly as I should have. I'm pretty
    sure that most people heard me, but it should have been louder. Anika, on
    the other hand, raced through her presentation and as a result, I don't
    think anyone understood her. We wound up finishing up about thirty seconds
    early.  </p>

    <p> Our classmates asked some good questions, which showed that our
    presentation was decent; they understood enough to ask questions. Anika,
    who spoke last, naturally received all the questions, but she handed them
    off to whomever she felt was best suited to answer them &mdash; that was a
    nice touch. There weren't a lot of questions, and none of them came to me.
    We should have discussed clothes beforehand because Lionel wore slacks and
    a sports jacket, and Natasha wore a dress skirt and blouse. Anika and I
    were dressed very casually, and it was a bit uncomfortable. </p>

    <p> Generally, though, I think we felt good about the work we'd done. I
    expect positive feedback and good grades. </p>

    <p> We only met briefly this week because we were mostly finished and we
    all had finals to study for, but I said I'd go through the paper one more
    time. We all agreed that we'd only meet briefly next week to address any
    large issues I might find.  </p>

    <p> I spent about another hour and didn't find anything major &mdash; just
    lots of little stuff that I could fix without anyone else's input. </p>

    <p> At the final meeting, we reviewed the paper to make sure it was ready
    for submission at the end of the week. As we went through it, Anika took
    issue with a few of the changes I'd made. The language I used was a bit
    ambiguous and it could be read to mean the opposite of what we intended.
    She was right, but I don't feel badly, because I don't know how she noticed
    it. It took the rest of us a while to see it. Maybe it was because we all
    know what we're trying to say, but once I saw it, I couldn't un-see it.
    When I finally did see it, I said I'd fix it, but I wasn't really sure that
    I could. Fortunately, Anika saved me. She said she had no problem doing it
    &mdash; as long as everyone trusted her (there wasn't enough time for her
    to make the changes and get us all to say OK in time). Of course we all
    trusted her and said so. </p>

    <p> The night before she sent it in to our instructor, Anika sent us a copy
    of the document to make sure we were all OK with it. I took a quick look
    and then wrote back to tell her to go ahead and submit it. </p>
