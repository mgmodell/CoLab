    <p> In group time the first week, we began by setting up weekly team
    meetings. I think we got lucky, because Anna is already a sophomore, while
    the rest of us are freshmen. It seems like she knows what she's doing. </p>

    <p> The project is fairly open-ended, so we brainstormed topic ideas for
    the rest of the time. I suggested some topics, but they weren't nearly as
    good as Anna's ideas. I knew they weren't that great before I said them,
    but when I caught a glimpse of Anna's face when I said them, I felt dumb.
    She told us that she's done this sort of thing before. Thankfully,
    everything I said was sort of overshadowed by Sam's contribution that no
    one knew how to respond to. When he speaks, I can't tell if he's serious or
    not. His suggestions are kind of funny, but I'm not sure that's his intent
    &mdash; he definitely has a unique approach. Kim mostly just listens; I
    guess she's shy or maybe just getting comfortable. Soon, everyone focused
    on trying to improve on Anna's suggestions.  </p>

    <p> Before the meeting ended, we narrowed it down to five ideas. Anna told
    us we should each look for resources on one topic and then report back next
    week. She spoke up for a topic she'd already worked on in another class.
    Sam quickly spoke up for another and, then I chose the most interesting one
    that was left. Honestly, though, I was disappointed because I liked the one
    Anna chose, but I'll give this a shot. Kim said she'd take the last two,
    but I guess Anna's concerned, so she offered to take one herself. Kim
    insisted, though, that she can handle it, so Anna split it with her. I'm
    nervous about Kim, too, because she hasn't said or contributed much, but
    that's fine. We've got time. </p>

    <p> I spent about 45 minutes researching my topic this week and I found a
    lot of materials, so I feel pretty good. </p>

    <p> We began the meeting by going over the materials we collected over the
    last week. Anna was clearly disappointed, and she didn't hide it well. She
    spent most of the meeting talking about how she did her research. It was
    helpful, but makes me feel like I'm a child. I'm going to have to do a lot
    of it again. Sam asked some questions indicating that he didn't see why his
    materials are mostly unusable, and Anna just laughed at him. He asked again
    and this time Anna responded with a few detailed questions that Sam
    couldn't answer. She then went to her own notes to answer the same
    questions. It seemed a bit cruel (and I'm glad it wasn't me) because I
    couldn't have answered those questions. Sure, they are important and all,
    but we're new to this and she's not. She's already worked on this topic
    before. </p>

    <p> I suggested that, in the interest of time, maybe we just go with the
    topic she worked on, but Anna insisted that we redo our work. She pointed
    out that we all need to be able to do the research. No one could argue with
    that, so we said we'd redo our work. </p>

    <p> The next night, I spent about another hour and a half finding and
    skimming through new materials. I was still able to use most of my original
    materials. I found a bunch of additional ones, too. I don't love this
    topic, though, so it feels like a waste of time. </p>

    <p> During this week's meeting, we sorted through the materials to decide
    on a topic; we have much better materials this week. It turns out that
    Sam's topic is really cool, but it was clear Anna was more interested in
    her own topic. So was I. It's really got the most potential, and we've got
    the best resources for it. We went back and forth for most of the meeting
    and it was a pretty good debate, but in the end, I thought Anna's topic was
    best, and Kim wound up agreeing with us (even though she started out siding
    with Sam). After Kim changed her mind, Sam agreed to go along. </p>

    <p> After the topic was settled, there wasn't much time, but Anna jumped
    right into drafting an outline, and she wouldn't let anyone else help. Sam
    had some interesting ideas about how to make the paper easier to read, but
    when he brought them up, Anna took it as a sign that none of us had ever
    written a research paper before. We all had to sit through her explaining
    to us what an outline is and why we use it &mdash; that's ten minutes of my
    life wasted. No one made any comments on the outline after that. </p>

    <p> When I suggested that we each take a few of our sources, search for
    more content on our own and then write up summaries for next week, Anna
    agreed and started assigning them out. She acted like she was the only one
    with a brain, however, and she didn't trust the rest of us to get anything
    right, so she took the materials that were actually interesting and offered
    any depth &mdash; strange, since she made such a big deal out of making
    sure we were all "learning" during the initial research. I wasn't the only
    one upset &mdash; Kim spoke up first to request a specific topic, and then
    Sam and I did the same. This clearly irritated Anna, but eventually she
    gave in and we each claimed the ones we most wanted. This seemed fine and I
    took one that I thought I could make into something interesting, but
    apparently Anna didn't think I could handle it. She told me she'd "help" me
    with it &mdash; like I'm incompetent or something. I just said OK and moved
    on &mdash; she can do what she wants, but I'm writing it. </p>

    <p> I spent about two hours on reading, searching and writing summaries. I
    like how it turned out. </p>

    <p> After class this week, Anna handed me her "help" &mdash; her completed
    summary was even longer than mine! Does she think I'm not competent to
    write anything? I wasn't sure how to respond; I just kept thinking this
    couldn't really be happening, but when I realized it was, I took the paper
    and walked away. When I got home, I found that she'd pulled out completely
    different main points. I can see that this is where she's going, but my
    approach is just as good, and I didn't have time to make any changes to
    what I'd written, anyway. </p>

    <p> I was a bit late to the meeting, but it was only about five minutes and
    Sam was just arriving when I walked in. I can tell that Anna wasn't
    thrilled with what I brought, but she was more upset that Sam didn't finish
    his part. She was particularly upset because she thought we were writing
    our completed portions to be added directly into the paper &mdash; and
    apparently no one else thought this. What does she expect? She tells
    everyone what to do because she's got more experience, but then she doesn't
    explain what she means &mdash; assuming that we have the same experience
    that she does. Kim called her out on this, asking why she wrote so much
    already when we're so early in the project. After all, we only have the
    preliminary structure done, and this is only the fourth week of class.
    </p>

    <p> Anna got upset and asked how she would be able to put anything together
    using materials as thin as this; that's when Sam spoke up. He made a joke
    about how poorly he'd done his part &mdash; his wasn't just thin, it was
    nonexistent. It wasn't that funny, really, but everyone laughed and he
    volunteered to assemble next week's assignment since he still has pieces to
    write. He also suggested that we take a look at what we've got and whether
    the outline we put together still fits. It was really either that or fight
    for another hour, so everyone was all for it. </p>

    <p> The discussion was OK, and Kim offered some really good ideas about how
    to sequence things. It helped me to see the paper differently, and it gave
    me some more ideas. Anna agreed that the sequence is a good idea, but Sam
    quickly pointed out that he wouldn't have time to do it all, and Anna
    started getting upset again. I also don't have time to help out;
    fortunately, Kim offered to make the changes if Sam could get the rest of
    it done by the middle of the week. Sam gladly accepted this, and they
    decided to coordinate later. </p>

    <p> Naturally, before we left, Anna had to remind everyone that we need to
    keep working on our summaries because we've got the draft due in another
    four weeks. </p>

    <p> I spent about half an hour on my sections this week, but I mostly
    focused on my other classes. </p>

    <p> Kim had our assignment ready and turned it in during class. The
    instructor allowed some time at the end of class this week, so we reviewed
    what she and Sam put together. It seems they met up in the middle of the
    week and finished it together. Anna was pleased with their work, so the
    meeting went pretty smoothly. </p>

    <p> My coach kept us late all week to prepare for a home game against our
    rivals in two weeks, so I was about twenty minutes late. It was a tough
    practice and I was exhausted, so when I arrived and the group was
    discussing our next steps, I suggested we take a break from it for a week
    while we wait for feedback from the instructor. Sam and Kim seemed to think
    this was a pretty good idea, but Anna got upset. She spent the next ten
    minutes explaining that she thought the instructor probably would barely
    look at our papers, much less provide meaningful feedback. She said it'd
    probably be weeks before we got it back; by that point, we'd have no time
    left to get our draft together. She kept talking about how we couldn't stop
    now because of midterms, scheduling and all sorts of other junk. I gave up
    because I just didn't want to hear any more. I really could have used a
    break, but I guess she won't let us have one. </p>

    <p> We split the paper up into quarters and each took a section to write up
    for next week. Before we left, I told everyone that I'd probably be late
    the next week because of our practices. </p>

    <p> I had to spend about two and a half hours writing my part of the paper
    this week. I mostly had to work with Sam's contribution and just a bit of
    Kim's. Sam's contributions were difficult to understand. He had some good
    points, but the way he wrote was very confusing and took a long time to
    understand &mdash; sometimes it was easier to just go back to the sources.
    They also seemed to miss part of the point. Ultimately, I had to write most
    of it from scratch. </p>

    <p> I was a little late again for our meeting this week because of
    practice. Before I arrived, the group went through Kim's and Sam's work. I
    didn't really get a chance to read either of them, but Sam included visuals
    in his and it makes a big difference! I guess that they all agreed and
    looked for places to add more. </p>

    <p> Next, we reviewed Anna's. She sort of apologized to me for changing it
    to make sure it all made sense and worked toward the same point. As I read,
    though, it became clear that she rewrote almost everything I gave her. I
    recognize it, of course &mdash; it's all very similar to the "help" she
    gave me. I completely wasted my time and might as well not have written
    anything!  </p>

    <p> I answered that it was her vision and not that of the group. Kim spoke
    up and took Anna's side, saying she liked where the paper was going. I
    realized that it didn't matter what I said or did, because we were just
    helping Anna write her paper. It wasn't a bad paper, but it wasn't ours
    either. It was clear that I'd have to rewrite most of the work I'd done
    this week, so we didn't bother looking at mine. </p>

    <p> As it turned out, I didn't have as many changes to make as I thought.
    It only took me about 45 minutes to fix it all up. </p>

    <p> I was a little late this week because I think I pulled a muscle or
    something in my leg at practice. When I arrived Anna yelled at me for it.
    Couldn't she see that I was limping? Anyway, what did it matter since she
    was writing the whole paper herself? We started to get into it but then Kim
    spoke up to calm us both down. She made Anna confirm (out loud) that we are
    all equals, working on this project together. Of course, Anna had to remind
    everyone that she had more experience than anyone else, but Kim pushed us
    on anyway. </p>

    <p> Anna was happy with everyone's work this week &mdash; especially mine.
    Of course, I'm basically just doing exactly what she told me. She was
    disappointed by Sam's work, and there are a lot of corrections to be made
    there, but it's nothing at all like last week. Anna told him she'd take it
    and rewrite it for next week. At this, Anna told us we needed to trade
    pieces and proofread each other's work for next week. Everyone was OK with
    this, but Kim wanted to get started on assembling the paper and volunteered
    to do that. Anna pointed out that it would be tough to match the individual
    pieces with the assembled document so that we could make the changes, Kim
    said she'd take care of it, so it was decided. </p>

    <p> As we were getting ready to go, I asked if anyone would mind changing
    our meeting time for next week &mdash; I had a study session to prepare for
    one of my midterms. Sam agreed and asked that we cancel it, since the paper
    is in pretty good shape. Kim was on board. Anna decided that we should
    still meet, but only briefly immediately after class to share our changes.
    </p>

    <p> I took Kim's piece and it was really in pretty good shape. I was able
    to read through it quickly and I had very few comments or corrections to
    make. I wonder if Sam will have much to say about mine. </p>

    <p> During this week's class some of the discussion touched on the topic of
    our paper, and it felt good to have a lot to contribute in class. There was
    some good debate about the competing points of view &mdash; specifically,
    there was a lot of interest in what I had written but that Anna had
    removed. Sam, although usually pretty quiet during class, even got in on
    the discussion and made a few good observations, although I'm not sure
    everyone really understood them. I landed in a pretty smart group. </p>

    <p> After class, we met briefly as we decided last week. Kim did a great
    job on the paper again, and Sam's diagrams were mostly spot on. One of them
    seemed odd, but I couldn't explain why. Fortunately, Anna understood and
    asked Sam to make a few changes in line with my comments. Sam said he
    wasn't a good enough artist, however. He said that he agreed with me and
    that he'd like to be able to do it, but he doesn't have the skill. I can't
    really argue with that, can I? Even like this, the diagrams really help to
    spruce things up and I didn't want to spend that much time on them, anyway
    &mdash; I was much more interested in the class discussion. Since Kim had
    done such a great job, most of our own comments and changes weren't
    relevant any longer, so we mostly just handed them to her to incorporate
    for next week. </p>

    <p> When I wanted to talk about fixing our paper because the class was
    interested in what I wanted to say, Anna said it was boring and that she
    didn't have time to explain all the problems with it and asked if we wanted
    to hold our regular meeting to discuss it. Of course, we couldn't do this
    because we all had other study sessions to go to, but Sam also wanted to
    include my perspective. Finally, Anna gave in and agreed to add a section
    on it, but she wouldn't let me to write it &mdash; like I'd screw it up or
    something! She said that she didn't want us turning in something that was
    "sloppy" &mdash; my work is not sloppy! Fortunately, Kim spoke up and asked
    Anna if she'd be OK with me writing it if she reviewed it first. Anna was
    OK with that, so Kim asked me to get it to her by mid-week. I feel like a
    child, but whatever. </p>

    <p> I wanted to make sure that Anna couldn't complain about it being
    "sloppy," so after spending an hour and a half writing the new section, I
    spent another hour proofreading it the next night before sending it to Kim.
    </p>

    <p> Kim had our paper ready to be submitted when she arrived in class. She
    also brought a copy for each of us to review. I took a look that evening
    and Kim had done a great job of adding in my new section. She'd made a few
    changes to make it clearer, but mostly used what I gave her. I thanked her
    during the week and she appreciated it. She also told me that she'd be
    about ten minutes late to our meeting this week. I mentioned it to Sam when
    I saw him in a class we share.  </p>

    <p> Unfortunately, we took this as a reason not to rush to our meeting, but
    no one mentioned it to Anna. She was packing up to leave when I arrived.
    Oops. She seemed really uptight and stressed in the meeting. She's never
    been fun, but this seemed different &mdash; she must have been really
    angry. </p>

    <p> Anna had a long list of changes to the paper and some of them were big,
    but no one said anything &mdash; I know I was feeling guilty and I imagine
    everyone else was, too. She asked us all to take another look at the whole
    paper and read it straight through for next week to make sure we haven't
    missed anything. </p>

    <p> Our next task was to begin preparing for the presentation. Anna drafted
    a PowerPoint for us to use, and then assigned slides to each of us. At one
    point, she asked if anyone was upset with their piece and no one was, so
    she kept going. She told us we needed to write up our talking points for
    each of our slides and practice a few times in front of a mirror for next
    week. </p>

    <p> I am pretty comfortable with my topic, and it didn't take me long to
    write down some notes on index cards. Honestly, I'm pretty good at public
    speaking, so I don't think I need to prep too much. </p>

    <p> Wow! Anna found nothing but fault in my presentation! She pointed out
    everything I forgot to include and didn't seem to like anything about what
    I did include. To be fair, she wasn't the only one, but she was pretty
    harsh. No one else did a great job, either &mdash; including Anna. She
    might think she's much better than all of us, but even she had a bunch of
    things to fix.  </p>

    <p> Sam's slides looked better than everyone else's because he used a lot
    of the diagrams he'd drawn, but he missed a few important points that
    weren't represented in them. Kim's was probably the best of all, but she
    spoke very quietly to her notes, rather than to the audience. After three
    practice runs, everyone took home a list of things to fix their
    presentations. </p>

    <p> I spent an hour and a half reworking my part &mdash; and then about
    half an hour practicing it. </p>

    <p> In class, the instructor returned the drafts to the groups, and we met
    briefly during class to review it. The instructor left only six comments in
    our paper, but one at the front of the paper read, "Interesting approach! I
    like that you reached beyond what we did in class." The instructor clearly
    praised the section I got Anna to include. Another comment complimented the
    images. One of the comments indicated a need to further develop a section,
    and another asked us to recheck one of our references. I couldn't wait to
    see Anna's reaction to the instructor's comment! I even fixed my
    presentation accordingly. </p>

    <p> Our meeting was frustrating because Anna wouldn't even consider the
    idea that the instructor's comment was referring to my addition. I can't
    believe I walked in thinking the paper would change the way I wanted it to.
    I walked out glad that I was able to keep any of my work in at all. Both
    Sam and Kim stayed out of the discussion. When I asked what they thought,
    they just shrugged. Anna said she'd make the changes the instructor
    requested this week. </p>

    <p> Everyone's presentations were better this week, but we still need more
    practice and rework. Sam and Kim had both fixed some parts of theirs, but
    we spent most of the meeting fixing other parts. Anna had improved upon
    hers significantly since last week. I don't know how she did it, but it
    sounded perfect. Finally, we talked about how we should dress for the
    presentation. Kim had a cool costume idea that was in keeping with our
    topic that Sam and I both liked, but Anna said that would look
    unprofessional. She said we had to wear business clothes. When we ended the
    meeting, Anna reminded everyone that our presentation is in just two weeks.
    </p>

    <p> Since I still had my old notes, it only took me about fifteen minutes
    to get my presentation back in shape again. </p>

    <p> Kim let me know that she'd be late because of another meeting, so we
    started without her. We spent some time reviewing Anna's changes to the
    paper, and then she asked Sam about the reference we needed to check on. He
    just laughed and rifled through his notes. He explained that it was a
    placeholder he threw in while he was writing, and he never got around to
    replacing it with the correct one. I got the feeling that he left it in
    there just to see if anyone would notice it at all. </p>

    <p> Kim arrived just as Anna finished looking at the changes. Kim asked us
    to take another look, but Anna told her to review it after the meeting,
    instead. Although it didn't seem like anyone made very many changes, the
    presentation felt much better this week. Whatever it was, after two
    practice runs, we sounded smooth. While it's still running too long, we
    agreed that everyone will probably speak faster in class, and the
    instructor probably won't be a stickler on time. </p>

    <p> We decided to end early this week, but before we split up, Anna
    wouldn't be Anna if she didn't remind everyone to wear formal business
    clothes to the presentation next week. </p>

    <p> I practiced once this week with a friend, but mostly I focused on my
    other coursework. </p>

    <p> We were the only group dressed professionally, and I think that
    probably earned us some points. Kim managed to speak loudly and clearly
    enough that the instructor only had to ask her to speak up once. I stumbled
    on my first few sentences, but then I relaxed and I think it went well. The
    biggest surprise, though was Sam, he added an analogy at the end that not
    only tied everything together, but also made everyone laugh. It was
    unexpected and risky, but it worked out well. There weren't a lot of
    questions for us and naturally, Anna stepped forward to answer them. </p>

    <p> I think we can expect positive feedback and good grades. </p>

    <p> Since the paper is mostly finished, we all decided to cancel this
    week's meeting and instead each give the paper one last review for the
    following week. </p>

    <p> At the final meeting, we compared notes and found that we had no major
    changes to make. Kim took all four versions and said she'd make what few
    changes there were and submit it at the end of the week. Anna asked her to
    send it to her first, because I guess she doesn't completely trust her. Kim
    was annoyed by this, but said she'd do it. </p>

    <p> As far as I know, the paper went in on time as planned and I imagine
    we'll get a good grade. </p>
