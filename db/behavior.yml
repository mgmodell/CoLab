  name_en: Equal participation
  name_ko: 
  description_en: >
    Each group member's contributions toward the group's effort are roughly
    equal. There will be variability in the types of contributions, and
    individuals may see ups and downs, but the overall responsibility is
    being fairly shared. <i>If no other behavior is clearly dominant,
    select this option</i>

  name_ko: 
  description_en: >
    This is when only one member of the group engages with the task at hand
    and the others actively avoid it.  The engaged member becomes
    overwhelmed, and joins the rest of the group in avoidance activities.

    the contributions of others.

  name_en: Social loafing
  name_ko:

    This is when an individual consistently under-contributes to the efforts
    of the group to achieve its goals. This forces other group members to
    do extra work so the task can be completed successfully.
